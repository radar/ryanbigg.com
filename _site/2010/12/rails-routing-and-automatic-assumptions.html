          <p>Last night while working on chapter 12 for <a href="http://manning.com/katz">Rails 3 in Action</a> I stumbled across an interesting problem detailed in <a href="https://gist.github.com/746414">this gist</a>. The problem I was seeing is that the <code>edit_admin_user_path</code> route <em>was not</em> failing, while the <code>admin_user_permissions_path</code> path <em>was</em> failing.</p>

<p>I had my suspicions to why the first link worked and spent the remainder of last night digging through my favourite bit of Rails and Rails related source(ry): Action Dispatch and rack-mount. I didn’t figure it all completely out until after a good night’s sleep. It wasn’t until I saw pixeltrix’s comment on the Gist this morning that it all clicked.</p>

<p>I knew from a while ago that sometimes Rails will just <em>know</em> what to put as the <code>:id</code> part of a route and I never did bother questioning how that part of Rails works until last night. It turns out that Action Dispatch (and by extension, rack-mount) are very intelligent in the way that they build routes. Take the <code>edit_admin_user_path</code> route for example. This requires two parameters: <code>:account_id</code> and <code>:id</code>, representing an account and user object respectively. The routing code doesn’t <em>care</em> what arguments are passed in here, only the order of them. All it does is call <code>to_param</code> on the objects to extract the segments for the routes. So when you do this:</p>

<pre>
   edit_admin_user_path(@user)
</pre>

<p>But the order of the parameters in the URL are <code>:account_id</code> and then <code>:id</code>, Rails will assume that the first object is meant for the <code>:account_id</code> parameter. How does it work out the <code>:id</code> parameter then? It’s not passed into the helper, so instead it’s gathered from the current request’s parameters. Therefore, this helper generates a URL such as <code>/2/users/2/edit</code> inadvertently. We can change this to be simply:</p>

<pre>
   edit_admin_user_path
</pre>

<p>Then Rails will assume that we want the current <code>:account_id</code> and <code>:id</code> from the current request, making our code much shorter, compared to what we’d have to do if this feature didn’t exist:</p>

<pre>
  edit_admin_user_path(@account, @user)
</pre>

<p>The <code>admin_user_permissions_path(@user)</code> helper throws an error because it expects to receive both a <code>:account_id</code> and <code>:user_id</code> parameter. Without the <code>:user_id</code> parameter available or passed in to the helper, rack-mount won’t know how to generate this URL and will raise a “No route matches” error.</p>

<p>Oh, and I also <a href="http://twitter.com/ryanbigg/status/16104049640210432">offered a free copy of Rails 3 in Action</a> to the person who helped me solve this issue, but it was really a team effort. alindeman, pixeltrix and pacsoe all get free, signed dead-tree copies when the book’s done. Thanks lads.</p>
