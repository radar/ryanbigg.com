          <p>About 6 months ago, <a href="http://drnicwilliams.com">Dr Nic</a> and I were in the local-to-work bookstore for a reason I can’t recall. What do I recall though is the good Doctor ripping a book off the shelves and saying “You’re buying this book. Then you’re going to read it.”.  This book was “How to Win Friends and Influence People” and it is in my (and millions of other’s) opinion(s) one of the greatest books ever written. It was written by Dale Carnegie in the 1930s and the wisdom in the words still holds true to this day. The foundations of human interaction has not changed much since those days, and it should not. I read the book, and it changed my perception of human interaction. I’m currently in the process of reading it again.</p>

<p>When I was in Scotland, I think on the Saturday before I left, I did to Sam what the Doctor did to me: pulled the same book off the shelf and said “You’re buying this book. Then you’re going to read it.” Sam whinged about paying for a book, so I paid for him. Then we took it home and it sat on the bookshelf in my temporary room for the next couple of days.</p>

<p>On the Monday, Sam had to take care of a couple of things for his new job and left me to my own devices. I took the book, a (“borrowed”) pen and my camera and went around town taking photographs. When my fingers got too numb from the cold, I stopped in at Costa for a hot chocolate and decided to write in the cover of the book. I’ve decided to post it here too because I feel some parts could apply to a greater “audience”. Here’s what I (hand)wrote:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
[page 1]<br />
To Sam,<br />
Be decisive!<br />
Smile!<br />
Enjoy life &amp; friends<br />
</p>

<p>
Please read this cover to cover. It is not intended as a slight on your awesome personality, but rather intended to suggest more ways you can be [much more] awesome. After reading it, you may realise you have done "the wrong thing". This is not the case, usually. We all do "the wrong thing" without realising it, and after reading this I often find myself thinking of how to be more patient and courteous to those around me, defusing otherwise emotional battles with people.
</p>

<p>
I have greatly enjoyed my time in Scotland with you and your family. Such generosity is rare and absolutely priceless in today's world. If any of you wish to visit Down Under, I will do anything in my power to help you enjoy it.
</p>

<p>
[Page 2]<br />
"He who can do this, has the whole world with him."
</p>

<p>
Process what other people say before formulating a reply, and never interrupt them. Think of how you'd feel if the tables were turned.
</p>

<p>
[Page 3]
I trust by now you are already bored of my scrawl. I would just like to say thanks again.<br />
And again.<br />
And again.
</p>

<p>
We all have the potential to be great/fantastic/awesome, so why not? Why not try improving somebody else's day? Give them a compliment (hint: girls like compliments on what they are wearing. A wolf whistle is <strong>not</strong> a compliment!). Perhaps if you improve their day, it may improve your day, or even your life. Take advice. Embrace the world's knowledge. Use it to <strong>your</strong> and <strong>everyone around you's</strong> advantage. This includes your parents who quite obviously love you very much. Just remember what I said.
</p>

<p>
[Page 4]<br />
Your parents have been around for <strong>twice</strong> as long as you have and have a great deal of knowledge. You may find, like I did, that co-operating with them is much easier than arguing. They only have <strong>your best interests</strong> in mind. They are great, but also as mortal as the rest of us. They will not be around forever. Enjoy as much time as you can with these fabulous people before you are unable to!
</p>

<p>
<ol>
<li>Be kind (aka, keep going)</li>
<li>What can you give others</li>
<li>Take advice and use it!</li>
<li>Read this book!</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>
So long, Sam.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>After I finished writing it, I put my spare travel money card in the middle and then snuck it into Sam’s bookshelf. When I left for home, I told him where I left it. He’s read it already cover to cover and appreciated my “foreword” and the book itself.</p>

<p>I really enjoyed Scotland and I wish Sam (and his family) all the best.</p>
