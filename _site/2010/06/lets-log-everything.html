          <p>The Australian Government <a href="http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/technology/blogs/the-geek/internet-freedom-in-2010-looks-like-1984/20100618-ykr9.html?rand=1276822049429">has put forward a scheme which they wish to log the activity of every user of the internet</a>. What. The. Fuck?</p>

<p>Must the government fear its citizens so much that it has to monitor their every movement? Lucky we have a lot of spare land to put the datacenters where to keep this new data they’ll be storing. This means data such as sixteen-year-old girls “liking” a picture on Facebook and writing comments like “omg hayley wat r u doing dere?”. Seriously, Australia? Fuck.</p>

<p>Again, it’s also a load of bullshit. Like the internet filter. People who want to keep their communications secret (VPN / SSL anyone?), will do it. The government <em>must</em> find an alternative solution that doesn’t involve tracking miniscule internet movements of the majority to capture such an infinitesimally small minority. One person’s a terrorist and suddenly we’re all suspected of it until proven innocent.</p>

<p>This is not the “democracy” I’ve grown up knowing. It’s, in the words of Muse, “demonocracy”.</p>

<p>It makes me sad that we have a bunch of old fogeys in their ivory towers scheming against the majority without asking it for their opinion. I thought that’s what democracy was about. I wish they’d climb to the highest level of their tower and defenestrate their pathetic ideas, followed shortly by theirselves.</p>

<p>You cannot protect everyone from everything all the time. Stop trying.</p>
