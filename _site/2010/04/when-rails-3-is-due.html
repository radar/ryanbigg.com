          <p>As a person who hangs out in #rubyonrails on Freenode a little too much of his spare time, I eventually come across repeated questions. This is why I made <a href="http://github.com/radar/railsbot">the channel bot</a> which runs on <a href="http://github.com/radar/summer">Summer</a>.</p>

<p>One of the hardest frequently asked question is “When is Rails 3 due?”, the next being “When is Rails 2.3.6 due?”</p>

<p>To be honest I don’t know, and I’m pretty sure not even Rails Core knows precisely when it’s due. Sure, they’ll have some kind of idea of when they’d like it to be released but it’s a very similar idea to mine of wanting to be rich (i.e. right now). <strong>Ideas and realities are two entirely separate worlds</strong>.</p>

<p><a href="http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2010/4/1/rails-3-0-second-beta-release">On the 1st of April, Rails 3.0.0beta2 was announced by DHH</a>. This announcement came very nearly two whole months after <a href="http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2010/2/5/rails-3-0-beta-release">first Rails 3 beta announcement</a>.</p>

<p>So why so long between releases? Well, lets go time traveling.</p>

<p>We travel back, <strong>back</strong> through time and its murk. We land spot bang in the middle of March 28, 2006. It’s on this day that a slightly-younger version of DHH <a href="http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2006/03/28/rails-1-1-rjs-active-record-respond_to-integration-tests-and-500-other-things/">announces Rails 1.1</a>. Oh look it has RJS. How young and foolish we all were. By we, I mean you guys of course, this was at least 3 months before I even begun getting into Rails. So Rails 1.1 was born into the world on March 28th, 2006. Right then. What about the next significant version?</p>

<p>The next version would be Rails 1.2, let’s jump forward to <a href="http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2006/11/23/rails-1-2-release-candidate-1">the first Rails 1.2 Release Candidate</a> on November 23rd, 2006. This is a distance of ~20,735,982 seconds (or in more sensible terms: 7 months and 27 days) between a major release (1.1) and a the next major release’s (1.2) release candidate. Ok, so when was the next release candidate?</p>

<p>That would be <a href="http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2007/1/5/rails-1-2-release-candidate-2">the second Rails 1.2 release candidate</a>. Somewhere between these two releases I joined the Rails fray. The distance between releases? ~3,715,200 (or in more sensible terms: 1 month and 13 days). They really didn’t waste much time getting this out the door, and with so many changes too! Next!</p>

<p>So with the release candidates out of the way <a href="http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2007/1/19/rails-1-2-rest-admiration-http-lovefest-and-utf-8-celebrations">DHH announces Rails 1.2</a>. This was a mere 17 days (~1,468,800 seconds in the “old money”) between release candidate and major release. 17 days (not a pattern) later, <a href="http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2007/2/6/rails-1-2-2-sqlite3-gems-singular-resources">Rails 1.2.2 is announced</a>. On Pi day in 2007, 36 days after Rails 1.2.2 is released, <a href="http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2007/3/14/rails-1-2-3-compatible-with-ruby-1-8-6-and-other-fixes">Rails 1.2.3 is released</a>. Then nothing happens for a while.</p>

<p>During the 30th September, 2007 <a href="http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2007/9/30/rails-2-0-0-preview-release">A Rails 2.0.0 Preview Release</a> is announced. Surely the 2.0 release has to be close, right?</p>

<p>Between the 2.0 release postings, on the 5th of October, 2007, 6 months and 19 days after Rails 1.2.3 is released, <a href="http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2007/10/5/rails-1-2-4-maintenance-release">Rails 1.2.4 comes out</a>. Then a mere week later, <a href="http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2007/10/12/rails-1-2-5-maintenance-release">Rails 1.2.5 is announced and released</a>. Rails 2 work continued through these releases, as indicated by a <a href="http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2007/11/9/rails-2-0-release-candidate-1">Rails 2 release candidate announcement</a> in the midst of November 2007. <a href="http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2007/11/24/ruby-on-rails-1-2-6-security-and-maintenance-release">Rails 1.2.6</a> was announced 1 month and 12 days after Rails 1.2.5 was. This was to be the final version 1 release before Rails 2.</p>

<p>On December 7th, 2007, <a href="http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2007/12/7/rails-2-0-it-s-done">Rails 2.0 was released</a> much to the joy of the Rails world. 10 days later <a href="http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2007/12/17/rails-2-0-2-some-new-defaults-and-a-few-fixes">Rails 2.0.2</a> comes out with “some new defaults and a few fixes”. Then nothing happens for a while, again.</p>

<p>Then <a href="http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2008/6/1/rails-2-1-time-zones-dirty-caching-gem-dependencies-caching-etc">Rails 2.1 came out</a>, on the 1st of June, 2008, 5 months and 23 days later.</p>

<p>Some more patch releases were made after the Rails 2.1 release. The 3rd of September is when <a href="http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2008/9/3/rails-2-0-4-maintenance-release">Rails 2.0.4, the first patch release is announced</a>, 3 months and 2 days later. On the 19th October, 2008, another patch release <a href="http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2008/10/19/rails-2-0-5-redirect_to-and-offset-limit-sanitizing">Rails 2.0.5</a> is released. This is 1 month and 16 days since the previous patch release.</p>

<p><a href="http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2008/9/5/rails-2-1-1-lots-of-bug-fixes">Rails 2.1.1</a> was released 3 months and 4 days after the Rails 2.1.0 announcement with “lots of bug fixes”. It seems they didn’t quite fix all the bugs as <a href="http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2008/10/23/rails-2-1-2-security-other-fixes">Rails 2.1.2</a> was released 1 month and 18 days later. The next minor release wasn’t far off, only 28 days, and that one was <a href="http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2008/11/21/rails-2-2-i18n-http-validators-thread-safety-jruby-1-9-compatibility-docs">Rails 2.2</a>.</p>

<p>It is important to note that it is around this point in time that <a href="http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2008/12/23/merb-gets-merged-into-rails-3">the Merb + Rails merger is announced</a> on the 23rd December, 2008. This merge would grow into what we will soon know as Rails 3.</p>

<p>The next minor release after that was the <a href="http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2009/3/16/rails-2-3-templates-engines-rack-metal-much-more">Rails 2.3 announcement</a>, 3 months and 24 days later on the 16th March, 2009, the first release of 2009. The next announced release occurred on the 20th July, 2009: <a href="http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2009/7/20/rails-2-3-3-touching-faster-json-bug-fixes">Rails 2.3.3</a>. Some security fixes are announced, making <a href="http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2009/9/4/ruby-on-rails-2-3-4">Rails 2.3.4</a> a reality 1 month and 15 days after the Rails 2.3.3 announcement.</p>

<p>Then we get to the most recent stable version of Rails: <a href="http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2009/11/30/ruby-on-rails-2-3-5-released">Rails 2.3.5</a>. This was released a total of 2 months and 26 days after Rails 2.3.4.</p>

<p>Now most recently, the Rails 3 betas. The first was announced on the 5th Feburary 2010, 2 months and 5 days after Rails 2.3.5 was released, which doesn’t mean much. What’s a more relevant statistic would be that it was released 1 year, 1 month and 14 days after the Rails + Merb merge was announced. The beta was a very large and sweeping change of just about everything in Rails, afterall, this is a major release. There is going to be some major differences.</p>

<p><a href="http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2010/4/1/rails-3-0-second-beta-release">Rails 3 beta 2</a>, announced on April fools day, 1 month and 25 days after the first beta release. DHH says that this release is “hopefully our last stop before a release candidate” <s>but again: nobody knows</s>.</p>

<p>13 days after this, <a href="http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2010/4/13/rails-3-0-third-beta-release">Rails 3 beta 3</a> is released and <a href="http://twitter.com/dhh/status/12120667185">DHH says “we’re getting close to home now!”</a>.</p>

<p>Once you know the release candidate goes out you’ll know there’ll be a huge hubbub of how momentous the ocassion is. I say everyone deserves a “huge round of applause” or whatever the internet equivalent is. The amount of work put in Rails 3 over the last year and a bit is tremendous. Then people can finally start (or continue, in some cases) migrating their plugins and gems over to Rails. Personally, I look forward to the day where I can begin a new Rails application using compatible versions of Cucumber and RSpec and the latest and greatest Rails 3 code.</p>

<p>This post is not intended to give a solid or even a vague guess at what the Rails 3 release date is going to be. If you want my personal opinion it’s going to be another 2 to 4 weeks (from April 5th, so April 15th-May 5th) before a release candidate. Pure, utter, guesswork based on observation. The regression tickets themselves do not seem overly complex and if they are the only thing in the way of a release candidate then I cannot see there being any major delay.</p>

<p><strong>May 9th update:</strong> So I was wrong about the release candidate. It happens. Things get delayed. My new guess is that they’ll release+announce the release candidate at or near the beginning RailsConf. For now, I suggest that we all start developing our applications on it now, so that we can get something <strong>strong</strong> for the community.</p>
