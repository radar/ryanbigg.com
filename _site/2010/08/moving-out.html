            <p>At the beginning of the week my housemates and I chat and the conversation was basically thus:</p>

<blockquote>
Housemates: "Ryan we love you (as a housemate) and we found this awesome 3 bedroom place in Ultimo, wanna come with us? It's big!"<br>
Me: "OMG YSPLZ" (I work in Surry Hills)
</blockquote>

<p>I went through the week thinking I was doing well with my housemates.</p>

<p>I come back this afternoon from a shopping trip and the conversation goes like this:</p>

<blockquote>
Housemates: "Ryan, our cousin is being kicked out because he had an argument with her housemate and we're thinking of letting her move in here."<br>
Me: "That's OK, we have the spare bed."<br>
Housemates: "No... could you leave in 4 weeks time so she could move in? She's family. Please?"<br>
Me: "..." (but in my head there was <a href='http://hachidori.org/blog/images/fffuuuuuu.png'>this</a>)<br>
Me: "Ok, I will see what I can do." (but in my head <a href='http://www.gymidiots.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/son-i-am-disappoint.gif'>this</a>)
</blockquote>

<p>So I find myself in quite the fun situation again of having to look for a new place. I&#39;ve re-opened my ad on easyroomate and hopefully I&#39;ll get as many bites as I did last time. I&#39;ve also been applying for some places and I got a pretty alright hit rate from that last time too. We&#39;ll see how things go this time.</p>

<p>So in 4 weeks time, I&#39;ll be out of this place and in my new one. I&#39;ll be sad to leave Marcelo and Larissa, but I suppose I do have to get out and explore some more.</p>

<p>Some may view this as a dickish move, but I don&#39;t. I understand where they&#39;re coming from. I hope them all the best and I have no bad feelings towards them. </p>

<p>I just hope I don&#39;t end up like <a href='http://www.kavistechnology.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/istock_000001389194xsmall.jpg'>this</a>.</p>
