          <p>I’m not sure if I’ve mentioned this before but I’m writing <a href="http://manning.com/katz">Rails 3 in Action</a> and what I haven’t mentioned before is that I need newbies.</p>

<p>Newbies are the lifeblood of the Ruby community and without them we wouldn’t have a solid foundation. A community without a healthy supply of newbies is a community <strong>that is dying</strong>.</p>

<p>Have you hugged your neighbourhood noob today?</p>

<p>The reason I need newbies is because I’ve got all these awesome reviewers, but most of them are <strong>experienced</strong> Rails developers who are probably assuming the same things I am when reading the book. Somethings to us <strong>just make sense</strong>. Newbies don’t have this ability yet, so I need a couple of people who are interested about learning Ruby on Rails to buy my book and give it a nice hard read. I need the newbies to be critical of everything they read. I need them to point out where a wall-o’-text would be better described in picture form and maybe even a quick sketch if they’re artistically inclined.</p>

<p>I am really appreciative of the current mob I have reviewing the book (and I’m not cheating on you!), I just need more newbies.</p>

<p>I’m going to need about 3 more people. These three newbies need to have enough spare time to be able to read the chapters as I’m progressing along with them and provide feedback. Question everything. Does it only make 99% sense? Question it.</p>

<p>In return, I’m told I give good, manly handshakes. I may give you one too. Alternatively if you prefer the whole monetary system, I will pay you the cost of the PDF / book and then maybe <strong>some more</strong>.</p>

<p>Who’s up for this? <strong>If you want to help, buy a copy of <a href="http://manning.com/katz">Rails 3 in Action</a>, have a read and post any issues you encounter on the forums! Thanks!</strong></p>
