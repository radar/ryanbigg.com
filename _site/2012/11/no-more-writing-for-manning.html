          <p>As of around this time last week, I am no longer writing for Manning.</p>

<p>This decision has been a long time coming. Ever since I started working for
Manning I’ve had issues with their tooling. I covered these in posts like <a href="http://ryanbigg.com/2011/11/don-t-print-hard-copies/">“Don’t print
hard-copies”</a> and <a href="http://ryanbigg.com/2010/12/the-writing-process/">“The
Writing Process”</a>).
They’ve been saying now for <em>two years</em> that they were going to fix it and…
nothing much has been done.</p>

<p>I got so frustrated with their system two weeks in, I decided to write my own.
I demonstrate part of Manning’s system and part of my own, in <a href="https://vimeo.com/45002976">this short
video</a>. I wrote my own review system in
a relatively short period of time.</p>

<p>The writing tools are something that I need to use everyday and if they’re just
getting in my way, it totally kills my vibe to write. I don’t want to hate
writing, because I <em>love</em> writing. I love the feeling I get when I can clearly
explain something to someone the first time in writing and they just <em>get it</em>.</p>

<p>So, no more writing for Manning because their tools for doing it are terrible.
The people at Manning are nothing short of excellent.</p>

<p>Rails 4 in Action <em>will</em> be published by Manning – they have the rights to the
book, not me – meaning they will need to source another author to do it. For
any questions related to that process, contact <a href="support@manning.com">support@manning.com</a>. They’ll know more about it
than I do.</p>

<hr />

<p>All of that doesn’t mean I’ve stopped writing Rails material completely. Oh no no no. You just wait.</p>
