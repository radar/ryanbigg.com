          <p>Hi,</p>

<p>My name is Ryan Bigg and I booked flights to Salt Lake City with a layover in Denver on the 14th of March. I’d never booked you
before. How did I find out about you? Well, there’s a handy site called <a href="http://hipmunk.com">Hipmunk</a> which is an aggregator for
flights, hotels and whatnot. You were ranked as the cheapest, and I figured what harm could there be in booking? The flight was a
perfect time, arriving at 4:25pm in SLC. Nobody else had flights arriving at such a perfect time as you.</p>

<p>First, a little bit of background on why I was going there in the first place. I’m a programmer. There’s a conference there called
<a href="http://mtnwestrubyconf.org/">Mountain West Ruby Conference</a> which I booked tickets to go to right before booking flights with you.
By arriving early in SLC, I hoped to catch up with some other programmer friends of mine and have a pre-conference dinner.</p>

<p>I arrived at San Francisco airport at 9:40am and checked in for the 10:45am flight. I was told there would be a delay of one hour and that I would miss my Denver connection. I would then have to make a later one at 9:20pm to go to SLC, arriving somewhere in the vicinity of 11:25pm. Too late to catch up with my friends.</p>

<p>At 11:45am, the screens still flashed “Delayed”. I didn’t want to approach the counter and ask about times because the hostesses
were already seemingly pushed to their limits. I truly, truly pity them in situations like this where they have to deal with
indignant customers. A very long time ago, I used to work in a similar role and know how bad people can get.</p>

<p>At around 1:30pm, I decided to go have lunch with the screens still flashing delayed. The line for the restaurant nearby was too
busy, so I went over to the store next door and bought some Pringles and a bottle of water. I then moved to one of the charging
stations next to Gate 41, which is right across from Gate 43. There, I waited for the flight. Still flashing delayed.</p>

<p>So I decided I would do some work to pass the time while waiting for your flight. I completely missed the announcement due to one
reason or another, and looked up to see the flight board had changed. Not once was I notified of a departure time for the plane,
either by PA or screens.</p>

<p>I approached the desk and was told that I had missed my flight. The really helpful air hostess with the patience of a monastery (who wasn’t wearing a name badge, so I couldn’t tell you her name) rebooked me on the next available flight, one that was supposed to be leaving at 2:45pm but was delayed until “Around 5”. This would mean that I would be cutting it fairly fine in my layover for Denver, but could still probably make it. (I later checked, the flight actually departed at 5:56pm, meaning I would have missed my connection and had to stay the night in Denver, and I would’ve missed the first day of the conference tomorrow)</p>

<p>As 5pm approached, I checked the flight status on Google. Originally, it told me 5:15pm. Then it told me 5:35pm, with an arrival time
within 19 minutes of my layover. Yeah, nah. Wasn’t going to make that.</p>

<p>Not once did I receive an email telling me that the flight was delayed. No notification over the PA at all. Not a single, iota, of
anything.</p>

<p>I contacted one of my programming buddies and he advised me that there was a SouthWest direct-to-Salt-Lake-City flight leaving
Oakland Airport at 8:40pm that was being sold for $267. I bought it. I approached the desk again and asked how I would go about
getting a refund, and aI was told (again, <em>super</em> politely!) that I would need to call Frontier. That’s very hard for me to do here,
because I don’t have a mobile phone that works in this great country.</p>

<p>I caught a cab ($125, including tip) to Oakland airport. Checked in at SouthWest who informed me that their planes had no such delay
and would depart on time. Yay!</p>

<p>So here I sit, at Gate 31 in Oakland airport, writing this to you in the ultra-vain hope that you’ll improve your systems. When your
flights have delays, PLEASE email your customers. I was constantly on the WiFi in SFO checking for notifications. Notify them over
the PA that a flight <em>may</em> be arriving at a specific time and to not go anywhere.</p>

<p>One final thing: I don’t know where my large suitcase is right now. The suitcase that has <em>all</em> my good clothes, some souveniers and
some other things. It could be in Denver, it could be in Salt Lake City. I don’t know. I can’t call anybody to ask. I will need to go
to Baggage Claim in SLC and hope that they have it there. If they don’t have it, then I’m out around $900 of equipment.</p>

<p>Your @FrontierCare account contacted me earlier and offered me a $50 voucher on future Frontier flights, but I don’t think that I’ll
be using it. I’ll be looking to get a refund (or at least, a partial one) for the flights that I’ve missed today. $50 is a paltry
figure compared to how much I could have potentially lost today.</p>

<p>Please, please, please improve your customer service experience. It is <em>not</em> rocket science.</p>
