            <p>My previous blog post got <em>very</em> different replies. On one hand they were like this:</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p>AWESOME! " Also, I’m 24.

<p>Others were humourous:</p>

<p>And others really hated it:</p>

<p>Everyone&#39;s entitled to have their say about this, and I&#39;m sad that so many people took offense to something that I genuinely believe should have been done.</p>

<hr>

<p>To make it clear, I don&#39;t like being cold-called. I think it&#39;s invasive and generally a waste of everyone&#39;s time. In the case of hiring, for a business person
to cold-call a whole bunch of programmers shows that they don&#39;t care about who they hire. They just want somebody to fill their position. </p>

<p>I think that they <em>should</em> care. Why? Well, the business person is going to spend <em>months</em>, perhaps <em>years</em> of their life with this person. How do you know
that person is going to be the right fit for your job? What if that person is a complete douchebag who will post most of the conversation on his blog and
laugh about it?</p>

<p>All I ask is that people who are looking to hire other people do their research first. Find out what they <em>love</em> doing and appeal to that, if you can. Invite
them out for a lunch discussion or if that doesn&#39;t work, a post-work drink or two. Cold-calling just anybody is most likely not going to land you the right person for your job. Go to meetups, programming events and meet people. Don&#39;t meet them just for the sake of seeing if they&#39;re wanting to go work for your company, but meet them to understand what their type is like.</p>

<p>To not do the research first shows a blatant disregard of care for the person that you&#39;re contacting, and I honestly think that contacts made in this fashion
cannot work out. Find common interests, discuss them in polite ways and see if you&#39;re a fit. If you&#39;re not, move on. Do your research on the next person.</p>

<hr>

<p>I agree that I started the email thread wrong. As I said before, I felt invaded by this email. Sure, I could&#39;ve ignored it and sent it to the Archive/Trash,
but that&#39;s not my style. If I am sending an email to a person, I expect a reply. Not an instant one, of course. Perhaps it would take a week or longer. But
still, a reply is always nice.</p>

<p>Replying in the way that I did was most certainly wrong. Cold-calling someone without doing any level of research before is wrong also. We were both wrong. Replying to somebody validates that &quot;Yes, you are worth my time&quot;. That&#39;s the <em>essence</em> of why I reply to every single email that is personally addressed to me.</p>

<hr>

<p>I want to make it so that recruiting in programming <em>doesn&#39;t</em> suck as much as it does now. Companies just want bodies, and while that makes sense in a business
fashion, how do you know if the new hire will be a good fit for the team or not and secondly if the work is interesting to them. If the new hire doesn&#39;t fit
with the team, then there&#39;ll be conflicts and inevitably someone will have an ego bruised, or worse. If the person doesn&#39;t enjoy the work, then they&#39;re
probably not going to work as hard as they could. Both of these things are absolutely vital to making someone fit in at a company, in my opinion.</p>

<p>I know all too well how <em>fucking great</em> we have it in this industry. I can announce on Twitter that I&#39;m leaving my current job and <em>within the day</em> I have at
least 5 companies saying &quot;Come work for us, please&quot;. I know how well we have this because I&#39;ve seen what happens in other industries, in a second person
fashion.</p>

<p>Recently, both my mum and her husband were out of work, and were struggling to find jobs. They weren&#39;t able to put out on Twitter (or Facebook) that
they were looking for a job and get picked up by a spectactular company within the same day. They had to work <em>damn hard</em> to find new jobs, and they&#39;ve done
just that. Even <em>with</em> all their experience (they&#39;re in their 40s), it was still a struggle for them to find a job.</p>

<p>So yeah, I know how great we&#39;ve got it in this fantastic industry of ours.</p>

<hr>

<p>I&#39;ll practice not being an arrogant asshole, and I&#39;ll expect people who are in the business of hiring others to practice doing their research. Together, we can
make this thing work and keep building this great industry.</p>
