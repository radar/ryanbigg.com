          <p><strong>Last updated: July 22nd 2020</strong></p>

<p><strong>This beginner’s guide will set your machine up with Ruby 2.7.1 using chruby+ruby-install and Rails 6.0.0 and is specifically written for a <em>development</em> environment on Ubuntu 19.04, but will probably work on many other operating systems, including older / newer versions of Ubuntu and Debian. YMMV.</strong></p>

<div class="warning">
  Under no circumstance should you install Ruby, Rubygems or any Ruby-related packages from apt-get. This system is out-dated and leads to major headaches. Avoid it for Ruby-related packages. We do Ruby, we know what's best. Trust us.
</div>

<p>This guide will cover installing a couple of things:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/postmodern/ruby-install"><strong>ruby-install</strong></a>: a very lightweight way to install multiple Rubies on the same box.</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/postmodern/chruby"><strong>chruby</strong></a>: a way to easily switch between those Ruby installs</li>
  <li><strong>Ruby 2.7.1</strong>: at the time of writing the newest current stable release of Ruby.</li>
  <li><strong>Bundler</strong>: a package dependency manager used in the Ruby community</li>
  <li><strong>Rails 6.0.0</strong>: at the time of writing the newest current stable release of Rails.</li>
</ul>

<p>By the end of this guide, you will have these things installed and have some very, very easy ways to manage gem dependencies for your different applications / libraries, as well as having multiple Ruby versions installed and usable all at once.</p>

<p>We assume you have <code>sudo</code> access to your machine, and that you have an understanding of the basic concepts of Ruby, such as “What is RubyGems?” and more importantly “How do I turn this computer-thing on?”. This knowledge can be garnered by reading the first chapter of <a href="https://manning.com/black2">any Ruby book</a>.</p>

<h3 id="housekeeping">Housekeeping</h3>

<p>First of all, we’re going to run <code>sudo apt-get update</code> so that we have the latest sources on our box so that we don’t run into any package-related issues, such as not being able to install some packages.</p>

<p>Next, we’ll run another command which will install the essential building tools that will be used to install Ruby:</p>

<pre><code>sudo apt-get install build-essential
</code></pre>

<p>And now we’re ready to install ruby-install.</p>

<h3 id="ruby-install">ruby-install</h3>

<p>The installation instructions can be found <a href="https://github.com/postmodern/ruby-install#install">on the README of ruby-install</a>, but I’ll repeat them here so you don’t have to go over there:</p>

<pre><code>wget -O ruby-install-0.7.0.tar.gz \
  https://github.com/postmodern/ruby-install/archive/v0.7.0.tar.gz
tar -xzvf ruby-install-0.7.0.tar.gz
cd ruby-install-0.7.0/
sudo make install
</code></pre>

<p>First we fetch the ruby-install file, extract it into a directory, then make it. You can verify that these steps have worked by running the following command:</p>

<pre><code>$ ruby-install -V
</code></pre>

<p>If you see this, then you’ve successfully installed ruby-install:</p>

<pre><code>ruby-install: 0.7.0
</code></pre>

<h3 id="ruby">Ruby</h3>

<p>Our next step is to install Ruby itself, which we can do with this command:</p>

<pre><code>ruby-install ruby 2.7.1
</code></pre>

<p>This command will take a couple of minutes, so grab your $DRINKOFCHOICE and go outside or something. Once it’s done, we’ll have Ruby 2.7.1 installed. In order to use this Ruby version, we’ll need to install chruby as well. The instructions <a href="https://github.com/postmodern/chruby#install">can be found in chruby’s README</a> too, but I will reproduce them here:</p>

<pre><code>wget -O chruby-0.3.9.tar.gz \
  https://github.com/postmodern/chruby/archive/v0.3.9.tar.gz
tar -xzvf chruby-0.3.9.tar.gz
cd chruby-0.3.9/
sudo make install
</code></pre>

<p>After this has been installed, we’ll need to load chruby automatically, which we can do by adding these lines to your shells configuration file using the following command:</p>

<pre><code>cat &gt;&gt; ~/.$(basename $SHELL)rc &lt;&lt;EOF
source /usr/local/share/chruby/chruby.sh
source /usr/local/share/chruby/auto.sh
EOF
</code></pre>

<p>In order for this to take effect, we’ll reload the shell</p>

<pre><code>exec $SHELL
</code></pre>

<p>Alternatively, opening a new terminal tab/window will do the same thing.</p>

<p>To verify that chruby is installed and has detected our Ruby installation, run <code>chruby</code>. If you see this, then it’s working:</p>

<pre><code>ruby-2.7.1
</code></pre>

<p>Now we need to make that Ruby the default Ruby for our system, which we can do by creating a new file called <code>~/.ruby-version</code> with this content:</p>

<pre><code>ruby-2.7.1
</code></pre>

<p>This file tells <code>chruby</code> which Ruby we want to use by default. To change the ruby version that we’re using, we can run <code>chruby ruby-2.7.1</code> for example – assuming that we have Ruby 2.7.1 installed first!</p>

<p>Did this work? Let’s find out by running <code>ruby -v</code>:</p>

<pre><code>ruby 2.7.1p114 (2019-10-01 revision 67812) [x86_64-linux]
</code></pre>

<h3 id="rails">Rails</h3>

<p>Now that we have a version of Ruby installed, we can install Rails. Because our Ruby is installed to our home directory, we don’t need to use that nasty <code>sudo</code> to install things; we’ve got write-access! To install the Rails gem we’ll run this command:</p>

<pre><code>gem install rails -v 6.0.0 --no-document
</code></pre>

<p>This will install the <code>rails</code> gem and the multitude of gems that it and its dependencies depend on, including Bundler.</p>

<h3 id="rails-pre-requisites">Rails pre-requisites</h3>

<p>Before we can start a new Rails app, there are a few more things that we need to install.</p>

<h4 id="javascript-runtime">JavaScript Runtime</h4>

<p>Rails requires a JavaScript runtime to run Webpacker for its assets.</p>

<p>To fix this error install <code>nodejs</code>, which comes with a JavaScript runtime:</p>

<pre><code>sudo apt-get install nodejs
</code></pre>

<p>On top of this, modern Rails uses <code>yarn</code>, a JavaScript package manager. We will need to install that too. The <a href="https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/#debian-stable">instructions are on the Yarn site</a> but here they are too:</p>

<pre><code>curl -sS https://dl.yarnpkg.com/debian/pubkey.gpg | sudo apt-key add -
echo "deb https://dl.yarnpkg.com/debian/ stable main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/yarn.list
sudo apt-get update &amp;&amp; sudo apt-get install yarn
</code></pre>

<h4 id="sqlite3">SQLite3</h4>

<p>First of all, we need to install <code>libsqlite3-dev</code>, which is the package for the development headers for SQLite3. We need this so that when <code>bundle install</code> runs as a part of <code>rails new</code>, it will be able to install the <code>sqlite3</code> gem that is a default dependency of Rails applications.</p>

<p>(If you’re using MySQL or PostgreSQL instead, see the sections below.)</p>

<h4 id="mysql">MySQL</h4>

<p>If you’re planning on using the <code>mysql2</code> gem for your application then you’ll want to install the <code>libmysqlclient-dev</code> package before you do that. Without it, you’ll get an error when the gem tries to compile its native extensions:</p>

<pre><code>Building native extensions.  This could take a while...
ERROR:  Error installing mysql2:
    ERROR: Failed to build gem native extension.

</code></pre>

<p>Install this package using <code>sudo apt-get install libmysqlclient-dev</code> and then the <code>mysql2</code> gem will install fine.</p>

<h4 id="postgresql">PostgreSQL</h4>

<p>Similar to the <code>mysql2</code> gem’s error above, you’ll also get an error with the <code>pg</code> gem if you don’t have the <code>libpq-dev</code> package installed you’ll get this error:</p>

<pre><code>Building native extensions.  This could take a while...
ERROR:  Error installing pg:

*** extconf.rb failed ***

</code></pre>

<p>Install this package using <code>sudo apt-get install libpq-dev</code>.</p>

<h3 id="fin">Fin</h3>

<p>And that’s it! Now you’ve got a Ruby environment you can use to write your (first?) Rails application in with such minimal effort. A good read after this would be the <a href="http://guides.rubyonrails.org">official guides for Ruby on Rails</a>.</p>

<p>The combination of chruby and ruby-install is such a powerful tool and comes in handy for day-to-day Ruby development. Use it, and not the packages from apt to live a life of development luxury.</p>
