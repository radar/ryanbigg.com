        <p>The news came out today that <a href="http://venturebeat.com/2014/10/01/after-raising-50m-reddit-forces-remote-workers-to-relocate-to-sf-or-get-fired/">Reddit is requiring all workers to move to San Francisco</a>. Of course, DHH (the guy who wrote <a href="http://37signals.com/remote/">a book about working remotely</a>) had an opinion about this:</p>

<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>What a coincidence <a href="https://twitter.com/sama">@sama</a> is &quot;not a fan of remote work&quot;, <a href="https://twitter.com/yishan">@yishan</a> sought his advice on canning remoters &quot;as friend&quot;, <a href="https://t.co/Bb5yjKZ68Q">https://t.co/Bb5yjKZ68Q</a></p>&mdash; DHH (@dhh) <a href="https://twitter.com/dhh/status/517475492296151040">October 2, 2014</a></blockquote>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>I&#39;m sure telling your your kids that daddy/mommy has to uproot the family for San Fran goes down smooth once you mention Optimal Teamwork.</p>&mdash; DHH (@dhh) <a href="https://twitter.com/dhh/status/517479897808531457">October 2, 2014</a></blockquote>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>Wanting to hire the very best and insisting they all live in San Francesco is simply delusional. Far more great people outside SF than in it</p>&mdash; DHH (@dhh) <a href="https://twitter.com/dhh/status/517481377487671296">October 2, 2014</a></blockquote>

<p>I haven&#39;t read DHH&#39;s book, but I agreed with him and even went as far as retweeting the last two tweets, which is unusual as I typically view DHH as person with extreme opinions and a &quot;fuck you&quot; kind of attitude that is rather grating when you&#39;re on the receiving end of it. Today though, he was spot on.</p>

<p>I worked remotely for two and a half years in my last job, wrote a book with an entirely remote team and therefore I can self-proclaim myself to be an expert on remote working. I would even go as far as to say that I&#39;ve done the best work of my life while being a remote worker. So when I hear about a company which self-proclaims itself to be &quot;The Frontpage of the Internet&quot; -- i.e. the front page of a globally distributed computer network -- moving their entire staff to San Francisco for &quot;optimal teamwork&quot;, it sounds very strange.</p>

<p>What even is &quot;optimal teamwork&quot;, anyway? You think that by magically gathering people in one building you&#39;re going to make them work any better than if they were apart? Do you think that they&#39;re going to not &quot;slack off&quot; because their boss can now come up behind them at any given moment? Do you think that they&#39;ll communicate better because they&#39;re all together?</p>

<p>No, they&#39;ll just work the same as they did before. They&#39;ll still slack off because humans aren&#39;t robots and like taking breaks every now and again from their work. It&#39;s actually provably beneficial to let people take breaks when they feel it&#39;s necessary to do so.</p>

<p>It&#39;ll be very interesting to see or hear about how bringing Reddit&#39;s team together works, or doesn&#39;t work and how many Redditors decide that the SF move is not for them.</p>
