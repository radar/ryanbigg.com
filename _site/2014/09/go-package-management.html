          <p>In Ruby-land, we have a wonderful tool called Bundler to manage package dependencies. I can specify dependencies like this:</p>

<pre><code class="language-ruby">gem 'rails', '4.1.5'
</code></pre>

<p>When I run <code>bundle install</code>, Bundler will install not only the <code>rails</code> dependency, but all of its dependencies and all of their dependencies and so on. It will then take note of the dependencies which have been resolved and save them to a <code>Gemfile.lock</code>. I can commit this file to Git and push it up to GitHub, then when other people work on my project they can clone it and run <code>bundle install</code> on their machine and work with the exact same dependencies. Another benefit of this is that I can have multiple versions of Rails installed on the machine and when I use Bundler, it will use the correct version of Rails as specified in the Gemfile.</p>

<p>There’s tools out there in Go-land, such as <a href="https://github.com/mattn/gom">gom</a> and <a href="https://github.com/tools/godep">godep</a> which provide similar functionality. I prefer <code>godep</code>, but truth be told I wish that there was a Bundler-for-Go. Godep saves the dependencies in a JSON file:</p>

<pre><code class="language-json">{
  "ImportPath": "github.com/radar/my-project",
  "GoVersion": "go1.3",
  "Packages": [
    "./..."
  ],
  "Deps": [
    {
      "ImportPath": "github.com/codegangsta/cli",
      "Comment": "1.2.0-22-g687db20",
      "Rev": "687db20fc379d1686465a28e9959707cd1acc990"
    },
    {
      "ImportPath": "github.com/fatih/color",
      "Rev": "3161cccfa22c6243e02aa984cf2886d022024cec"
    },
    {
      "ImportPath": "gopkg.in/check.v1",
      "Rev": "5b76b26efe7f426789852e983fbde4de62c42282"
    }
  ]
}
</code></pre>

<p>This is a pretty good solution. <code>godep save</code> will update the dependencies (similar to <code>bundle update</code>), and <code>godep restore</code> will install the dependencies (similar to <code>bundle install</code>) if they aren’t available in <code>GOPATH</code> already.</p>

<hr />

<p>Here’s what I would like though: I want a way that I can specify dependencies for Go projects like I can specify for Ruby projects. Ruby projects have a <code>.gemspec</code> file <a href="http://git.io/teWNMw0">which lists dependencies</a>, and I would like Go projects to do the same thing. For instance, in my project I’d like to specify my dependencies in a very simple JSON syntax (let’s call it <code>deps.json</code>):</p>

<pre><code class="language-json">[
  {
    path: "github.com/codegangsta/cli",
    rev: "1.2.0",
  },
  {
    path: "github.com/fatih/color",
    rev: "master",
  }
]
</code></pre>

<p>Then I would like to run a <code>bundle install</code>-equivalent which creates a <code>deps.json.lock</code>:</p>

<pre><code class="language-json">[
  {
    path: "github.com/codegangsta/cli",
    rev: "565493f259bf868adb54d45d5f4c68d405117adf",
  },
  {
    path: "github.com/fatih/color",
    rev: "3161cccfa22c6243e02aa984cf2886d022024cec",
  }
]
</code></pre>

<p>That’s the first step. The second step is a lot more complex than that, and it involves fetching the dependencies from their sources and setting up a proper <code>GOPATH</code>. See, the issue with the normal <code>GOPATH</code> is that all your dependencies are thrown into the one <code>src</code> directory. This means that if you want to use “Version A” of a project in “Codebase A” and “Version B” of that same project in “Codebase B”, you’re going to have a bad time. This is why I think having a <em>global</em> <code>GOPATH</code> is a terrible idea.</p>

<p>Instead, there should be a project-specific <code>GOPATH</code>. It looks the same as a normal <code>GOPATH</code>, but has the correct dependencies in it. For instance, instead of having a <code>~/Projects/go/src/github.com/radar/my-project</code>, I would have <code>~/Projects/go/my-project</code>, and then underneath that it would have <code>bin</code>, <code>pkg</code> and <code>src</code> directories relevant only to that project. The project’s code itself would exist within <code>Projects/go/my-project/src/github.com/radar/my-project</code>, only because that’s what Go expects.</p>

<p>To setup the project, I would create <code>~/Projects/go/my-project/src/github.com/radar/my-project</code>, and then run that <code>bundle install</code> equivalent. This would clone <code>github.com/codegangsta/cli</code> into <code>~/Projects/go/my-project/src/github.com/codegangsta/cli</code>, and check it out to the ref specified in <code>deps.json.lock</code>. It would then do the same thing with <code>github.com/fatih/color</code>. Now I have the first layer of dependencies that <code>my-project</code> needs.</p>

<p>The third step is where it gets <em>even more difficult</em>. These first layer of dependencies <em>might</em> have dependencies themselves, and so this tool should check for <code>deps.json.lock</code> (or <code>deps.json</code>) within those projects and resolve them as well. This is difficult because you may run into issues like circular dependencies and conflicting version requirements.</p>

<p>I believe if project setup was done this way, multiple Go projects on the same machine can use varying dependencies very easily.</p>

<p>There’s of course caveats: potential disk usage problems, every project needs a <code>deps.json</code>, and the resolution problems. By no means am I suggesting that this is <em>The Way Things Should Be Done</em>. It’s just something that occurred to me tonight that could be a potential beginning towards a solution for the Go package management puzzle.</p>
