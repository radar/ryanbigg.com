    Hello! You probably have been sent this page because you're a recruiter, or you've cold-contacted me offering me a job.
  </p>

  <hr />

  <p>
    <strong>I am not currently interested in taking on new jobs from cold contacts. I have no problem finding jobs based on my reputation in the worldwide developer community. Thank you, but no thank you.</strong>
  </p>

  <p>
    I explain this a bit more <a href='/work.html'>over on this page.</a>
  </p>

  <hr />

  <p>
    <a href='https://au.linkedin.com/in/ryan-bigg-73379b9a'>My LinkedIn profile</a> says this:
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    No recruiters, thanks.
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    <a href='http://ryanbigg.com/contact-me'>My "Contact me" page</a> has this paragraph:
  </p>

  <blockquote>
   Recruiters: please include the phrase <strong>"Bravo Foxtrot Uniform"</strong>, just so I know that you've done your research.
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    If you're a recruiter and you're reading this page: you have probably already
    failed my first two tests. You <em>didn't</em> include the magical phrase and you
    <em>didn't</em> follow my precise "no recruiters" instructions.
  </p>

  <p>
    I have these two checks in place for a <em>very</em> good reason: I get contacted by
    a lot of people (recruiters and otherwise) about jobs, career opportunities,
    and related things. These two tests are the only way that I know that you've
    done your research on me and that you've figured out that I'm an <em>especially</em>
    good fit for the job, and not just another warm body that knows how to code. There are plenty of
    places that could hire me for my warm-bodyness, and a select few that would
    hire me for my skills and good fit into the company and their culture.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>
      If you've reached this page, you're treating me like a warm body.</strong> In my
  professional experience, these kinds of job placements don't pan out well for company or candidate, and so I'm actively trying to avoid them.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>I will only consider job offers from people who have done their research. Recruiters (or otherwise) who "cold-call" me through LinkedIn (or whatever) will be shown this page.</strong>
