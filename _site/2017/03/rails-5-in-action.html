              <h2>Rails 5 in Action</h2>
            </a>
            <small>30 Mar 2017</small>
          </div>
          <p>I have been asked a few times since Rails 5 was released when Rails 5 in Action (an update to <a href="https://www.manning.com/books/rails-4-in-action">Rails 4 in Action</a>) will be published. The short answer is that it won’t be.</p>

<p>After Rails 4 in Action, I cut ties with Manning due to problems I’ve outlined in many previous posts. Most recently <a href="http://ryanbigg.com/2015/08/my-self-publishing-success-story">“My self-publishing success story”</a>. It just isn’t worth any more energy/time to continue to work with that particular publisher. Since they are the ones that own the rights to the Rails * in Action series and the IP of the book, working on an update to Rails 4 in Action would mean working with the publisher, and that’s not something that I would choose to do again.</p>

<p>Couple this with a 3-year “no-compete” clause that means I won’t be able to publish any book-length Rails beginner content. So even a competing book to Rails 4 in Action is out of the question (at least for the next two and a bit years).</p>

<p>So Rails 5 in Action is <em>never</em> coming out. <a href="https://github.com/rubysherpas/r4ia_examples/">Rails 4 in Action’s code</a> will still work with Rails 5 (mostly) and it’s a valuable demonstration of how to build a decently sized Rails application.</p>
