            <small>22 Jun 2017</small>
          </div>
          <p>This blog post has been <a href="https://techracho.bpsinc.jp/hachi8833/2017_08_01/43810">translated into Japanese</a>, thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/hachi8833">@hachi8833</a>!</p>

<p>I was made aware of <a href="https://github.com/rails/rails/commit/24a864437e845febe91e3646ca008e8dc7f76b56">this commit</a> recently (thanks to Rebecca Skinner) to Rails which introduces what is effectively a global state to Rails applications.</p>

<p>Rather than writing why global state in-general is a bad thing myself, I will instead link you to this <a href="https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/148108/why-is-global-state-so-evil">excellent question + answer on the Software Engineering Stack Exchange</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Very briefly, it makes program state unpredictable.</p>

  <p>To elaborate, imagine you have a couple of objects that both use the same global variable. Assuming you’re not using a source of randomness anywhere within either module, then the output of a particular method can be predicted (and therefore tested) if the state of the system is known before you execute the method.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This implementation also chooses to use <a href="https://github.com/rails/rails/commit/24a864437e845febe91e3646ca008e8dc7f76b56#diff-3c3c0f647bc4702f9453c173a707aa06R90">thread-local variables</a> which <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/8291218/15245">this answer over on Stack Overflow</a> explains is not a good choice because:</p>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li>It’s harder to test them, as you will have to remember to set the thread-local variables when you’re testing out code that uses it</li>
    <li>Classes who use thread locals will need knowledge that these objects are not available for them but inside a thread-local variable and this kind of indirection usually breaks the law of demeter</li>
    <li>
      <table>
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td>Not cleaning up thread-locals might be an issue if your framework reuses threads (the thread-local variable would be already initiated and code that relies on</td>
            <td> </td>
            <td>= calls to initialize variables might fail</td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>
    </li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>Not to mention that this also violates the well-established <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_Demeter">Law of Demeter</a> too. Suddenly, <code>Current</code> is available <em>anywhere</em> in your application. Good code is <em>explicit</em> in how it makes data available to its methods / functions. This <code>CurrentAttributes</code> feature is not good code, nor is it making it <em>explicitly clear</em> how <code>Current.user</code> arrives in the model. It is just there “magically”.</p>

<p>I enjoy and have benefited from Rails magic in the past. Some of my favourite features are <code>render @collection</code> and the <a href="http://ryanbigg.com/2012/03/polymorphic-routes">polymorphic routing</a>. Those are great features because their scope is limited. I know that I can render a collection in a view. I know I can use polymorphic routing in controllers, models and helpers.</p>

<p>This <code>CurrentAttributes</code> is much too magical for my liking because of how it introduces a thread-local global state which hides where the actual work of setting values on <code>Current</code> is done, and because it is <em>implicit</em> about where those values come from.</p>

<p>“They’re just set in the controller!”, may be a defense for this. But what if you don’t have a controller? What if you have a background job instead? How about a test? True, in both cases you could use <code>Current</code> to provide the values:</p>

<pre><code class="language-ruby">def perform(user_id, post_id)
  Current.user = User.find(user_id)
  post = Post.find_by(post_id)
  post.run_long_running_thing
  # code to run the job goes here
end
</code></pre>

<p>Here, <code>Post#run_long_running_thing</code> can simply access the current user by accessing <code>Current.user</code>. But it is not immediately clear – if all you’re looking at is the <code>Post#run_long_running_thing</code> method – where <code>Current.user</code> is being set in the first place. It’s implied that it’s set somewhere else, but to attempt to find where it’s set in this context may be difficult. Doing a find in the project for <code>Current.user =</code> may turn up multiple places (controllers, jobs, etc.) where the variable is set. Which one is the right one <em>for this context</em>?</p>

<p>As for tests, for those you would need to setup <code>Current.user</code> before hand if you had any code relying on that. I’d imagine something like:</p>

<pre><code class="language-ruby">let(:user) { FactoryGirl.create(:user) }
before { Current.user = user }

it "runs the long running thing" do
  post.run_long_running_thing
end
</code></pre>

<p>Again, it is not explicit when you’re looking at the <code>run_long_running_thing</code> method or its tests where <code>Current.user</code> is being set.</p>

<p>There doesn’t appear to be anywhere in the <code>CurrentAttributes</code> code – as far as I can tell – where it would reset the state of this <code>Current</code> object in between each test. Therefore, setting it in one test like what I’ve done above now makes it bleed through “magically” into other tests. That behaviour seems like a horrible thing to have in a codebase. You could very well have situations where you’re <em>expecting</em> <code>Current.user</code> to be <code>nil</code> but instead it’s set to some vaule because some other test set it. Now which of the 500 tests in my application did that? Good luck finding it.</p>

<h3 id="convention-over-configuration-and-perhaps-explicitness-over-implicitness">Convention over configuration, and perhaps explicitness over implicitness?</h3>

<p>Rails is still a good framework. I know DHH’s rebuttal to this will be “don’t use it then” or something along those lines. Similar to his response to <a href="https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/25115">my reverting of callback suppression</a> a while back.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Protecting programmers from themselves is explicitly not in the charter for Rails when it comes to providing features that have a valid use case but could be abused.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I just can’t reason with the guy at all. We have vastly different opinions on this sort of thing.</p>

<p>I think Rails choosing to go with ultra-implicitness – like in this <code>Current</code> case – is a vastly wrong move that will lead to a lot of frustration with Rails codebases that use this feature. I think Rails should, in situations like this, choose to opt for explicitness over implicitness. Rails has enough magic in it and it certainly doesn’t need any more.</p>

<p>This feature is not something that was sought after (it appears like DHH thought it was a good idea one day and just <em>did it</em>), and we have much better ways of doing this. For instance, in the job code above, it would be better to pass it explicitly:</p>

<pre><code class="language-ruby">def perform(user_id, post_id)
  user = User.find(user_id)
  post = Post.find_by(post_id)
  post.run_long_running_thing(user)
  # code to run the job goes here
end
</code></pre>

<p>Similarly, in the test explictness also wins:</p>

<pre><code class="language-ruby">let(:user) { FactoryGirl.create(:user) }

it "runs the long running thing" do
  post.run_long_running_thing(user)
end
</code></pre>

<p>In both of these cases, it is <em>very</em> clear how <code>user</code> arrives in the <code>run_long_running_thing</code> method: it is passed in as an argument.</p>

<p>Let’s finish by taking a look at the code from the pull request and look at how it can be written more explicitly.</p>

<h3 id="dhhs-currentattributes-code-vs-my-explicit-code">DHH’s CurrentAttributes code vs my explicit code</h3>

<pre><code class="language-ruby"># app/models/current.rb
class Current &lt; ActiveSupport::CurrentAttributes
  attribute :account, :user
  attribute :request_id, :user_agent, :ip_address

  resets { Time.zone = nil }

  def user=(user)
    super
    self.account = user.account
    Time.zone = user.time_zone
  end
end

# app/controllers/concerns/authentication.rb
module Authentication
  extend ActiveSupport::Concern

  included do
    before_action :set_current_authenticated_user
  end

  private
    def set_current_authenticated_user
      Current.user = User.find(cookies.signed[:user_id])
    end
end

# app/controllers/concerns/set_current_request_details.rb
module SetCurrentRequestDetails
  extend ActiveSupport::Concern

  included do
    before_action do
      Current.request_id = request.uuid
      Current.user_agent = request.user_agent
      Current.ip_address = request.ip
    end
  end
end

class ApplicationController &lt; ActionController::Base
  include Authentication
  include SetCurrentRequestDetails
end
</code></pre>

<p>Including the <code>Authentication</code> module into <code>ApplicationController</code> to add a single method seems like a bit of premature extraction. Let’s ignore that for now.</p>

<p>This implementation with its <code>before_action</code> to <code>set_current_authenticated_user</code> will mean that <code>Current.user</code> is set on all requests, even those which don’t refer to the <code>current_user</code> at all.</p>

<p>A better implementation would be a <code>current_user</code> method which evaluates its <code>find</code> when it is called. You’ll see this pattern in a lot of Rails applications.</p>

<pre><code class="language-ruby">def current_user
  @current_user ||= User.find(cookies.signed[:user_id])
end
</code></pre>

<p>In fact, this is similar to <a href="https://github.com/plataformatec/devise/blob/master/lib/devise/controllers/helpers.rb#L123-L125">how Devise presents its <code>current_user</code> method</a>. It uses <code>warden</code> instead of <code>cookies.signed</code>, but it’s implementation is similar enough:</p>

<pre><code class="language-ruby">def current_#{mapping}
  @current_#{mapping} ||= warden.authenticate(scope: :#{mapping})
end
</code></pre>

<p>Ok, so now we’ve got a <code>current_user</code> method which is available in the <em>controllers</em> but what if we want to use it in the view? For instance, if we want to say <code>Hello, #{current_user.name}</code> in a layout? Easy enough: make it a helper method.</p>

<pre><code class="language-ruby">def current_user
  @current_user ||= User.find(cookies.signed[:user_id])
end
helper_method :current_user
</code></pre>

<p>Great, so now it’s available in controllers, helpers and views. All without making it available <em>everywhere</em> in the current thread.</p>

<p>Now I would like to focus on the second half of DHH’s code:</p>

<pre><code class="language-ruby">class MessagesController &lt; ApplicationController
  def create
    Current.account.messages.create(message_params)
  end
end

class Message &lt; ApplicationRecord
  belongs_to :creator, default: -&gt; { Current.user }
  after_create { |message| Event.create(record: message) }
end

class Event &lt; ApplicationRecord
  before_create do
    self.request_id = Current.request_id
    self.user_agent = Current.user_agent
    self.ip_address = Current.ip_address
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>Here, DHH is <em>implicitly</em> linking the message’s creator to the <code>Current.user</code> by using the <code>default</code> option on <code>belongs_to</code>. I believe that this violates the MVC layer abstraction. The <code>Current.user</code> is just “magically” available in the model, with absolutely no context of how it got there in the first place.</p>

<p>A common pattern in Rails applications is not to do this, but instead to explicitly set the <code>creator</code> at the point of creation:</p>

<pre><code class="language-ruby">def create
  @message = current_account.messages.create(message_params)
  @message.creator = current_user
</code></pre>

<p>Let’s assume <code>current_account</code> is a similar abstraction to the <code>current_user</code> one. It’s clear here that in the controller that <em>this</em> is where the <code>creator</code> is assigned. With DHH’s code, it is not immediately clear from the controller code itself that <code>creator</code> is assigned at all.</p>

<p>Not only that, but this also lends itself to being abstracted into a “service object” which is responsible for creating a message. Let’s say that you want to log an <code>Event</code> whenever a <code>Message</code> is created. Oh, I see DHH’s code does that already with an <code>after_create</code> callback. Well then.</p>

<p>In the case of DHH’s code, the <code>after_create</code> callback will happen whenever a <code>Message</code> is created anywhere in your application. This might be suitable in a controller, but what if you want to test some database logic, or something else which requires a persisted message, and you don’t care about an event being there at the same time? What if when you created an event you had extra logic on it which caused <em>another</em> record to be created too?</p>

<p>Having such a callback irrevocably ties together messages and events <em>implicitly</em>.</p>

<p>As I mentioned before, it would be better to abstract this into a “service object”.</p>

<pre><code class="language-ruby">class CreateMessageWithCreator
  def self.run(params, current_user)
    message = current_account.messages.create(message_params)
    message.creator = current_user
    message.save
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>You can then call this code in your controller like this:</p>

<pre><code class="language-ruby">def create
  if CreateMessageWithCreator.run(message_params, current_user)
    Event.create(record: record)
    flash[:notice] = "Message sent!"
    redirect_to :index
  else
    flash[:alert] = "Message failed to send."
    render :new
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>This way, then you would know that in <em>this particular case</em> you’re <em>definitely</em> creating a message with a linked creator and it frees you up to create messages without creators or events, if the need did arise.</p>

<p>I think having these dependencies clearly highlighted in the code rather than magically abstracted away is a much, much better solution.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Introducing a global state to Rails seems like a terrible idea and while I deeply, deeply wish this change is reverted, that is very likely not going to happen because it’s DHH’s change and it’s his framework. DHH is allowed to be a footgun merchant if he wishes to be. I am just sad to see that, despite evidence that this is a genuinely bad idea, DHH carried on with it. I thought with his years of experience he would know better by now.</p>
