          <p>Really early on in Rails, you would write routes like this:</p>

<pre><code class="language-ruby">redirect_to :controller =&gt; "posts", :action =&gt; "show", :id =&gt; @post.id
</code></pre>

<p>What this would do is dutifully redirect to the <code>show</code> action inside the <code>PostsController</code> and pass along the <code>id</code> parameter with a
value of whatever <code>@post.id</code> returns. Typical 302 response.</p>

<p>Then Rails 1.2 came along and allowed you to use routing helpers, like this:</p>

<pre><code class="language-ruby">redirect_to post_path(@post)
</code></pre>

<p>And the people rejoiced.</p>

<p>This would do effectively the same thing. <code>post_path</code> here would build a route using the <code>@post</code> object that would look something
like <code>/posts/1</code> and then <code>redirect_to</code> would send back a 302 response to that route and the browser would follow it.</p>

<p>Then later versions (I can’t remember which one), allowed syntax like this:</p>

<pre><code class="language-ruby">redirect_to @post
</code></pre>

<p>And the people rejoiced a second time.</p>

<h3 id="magic-but-not-really">Magic, but not really</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>While this seems like magic, it’s not. What this is doing is actually very, very neat. The <code>redirect_to</code> method, much like its cousins <code>link_to</code> and <code>form_for</code> all use a common method to build URLs, called <code>url_for</code>. The <code>url_for</code> method takes many different varieties of objects, such as strings, hashes or even instances of models, like in the example above and then uses whatever’s input to build a URL. <code>url_for</code> does this in conjunction with another method called <code>polymorphic_url</code> too.</p>

<p>Let’s look at what <code>redirect_to</code>, <code>url_for</code> and <code>polymorphic_url</code> does with these objects. In the case of the <code>redirect_to @post</code> call above, it inspects the <code>@post</code>
object, sees that it is an object of the <code>Post</code> class (we assume, anyway) and checks to see if that object has been persisted in a
database somewhere by calling <code>persisted?</code> on it.</p>

<p>By “persisted”, I mean that a Ruby object has a matching record in the database somewhere. The <code>persisted?</code> method in Active Record is implemented like this:</p>

<pre><code class="language-ruby">def persisted?
  !(new_record? || destroyed?)
end
</code></pre>

<p>If the object wasn’t created through a call such as <code>Model.new</code> then it won’t be a new record, and if it hasn’t had the <code>destroy</code> method called on it won’t be
destroyed either. If both of these cases are true, then that makes the object has most likely been <em>persisted</em> to the database in the form of a record.</p>

<p>If it has been persisted, then <code>url_for</code> knows that this object can be found
somewhere, and that the place it can be found is most likely under a method called <code>post_path</code>. It infers the “post” part of this method from the name of the model: <code>Post</code>. Rails then calls this method, and passes in whatever <code>to_param</code> on the model returns. By default, <code>to_param</code> is configured to return the <code>id</code>, but you can override this method in your model to return something else, like a permalink instead:</p>

<pre><code class="language-ruby">def to_param
  permalink
end
</code></pre>
<p>In short, Rails is effectively building a method call like this:</p>

<pre><code class="language-ruby">#{@post.class.downcase}_path(@post.to_param)
</code></pre>

<p>Which comes out to being this:</p>

<pre><code class="language-ruby">post_path(1)
</code></pre>

<p>And when that method is called you would get this little string:</p>

<pre><code>"/posts/1"
</code></pre>

<p>Lovely!</p>

<p>This is called <em>polymorphic routing</em>. You can pass an object to methods like <code>redirect_to</code>, <code>link_to</code>, <code>form_for</code> and <code>form_with</code> and Rails will
attempt to work out the correct URL of what to use.</p>

<h3 id="the-form-of-form_form">The form of form_form</h3>

<p>Now, when you’re coding Rails you may have used <code>form_for</code> like this a very long time ago:</p>

<pre><code class="language-erb">&lt;% form_for @post, :url =&gt; { :controller =&gt; "posts", :action =&gt; "create" } do |f| %&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Of course, with advancements in Rails you could simplify it to this:</p>

<pre><code class="language-erb">&lt;% form_for @post, :url =&gt; posts_path do |f| %&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Because the form is going to default to having a <code>POST</code> HTTP method and therefore a request to <code>posts_path</code> is going to go to the
<code>create</code> action of <code>PostsController</code>, rather than the <code>index</code> action, which is what would result if it were a <code>GET</code> request.</p>

<p>But why stop there? Why not just write this?</p>

<pre><code class="language-erb">&lt;%= form_for @post do |f| %&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Personally, I see no reason not to… if it’s something as simple as this. The <code>form_for</code> method uses <code>url_for</code> underneath, just like
<code>redirect_to</code> to work out where the form should go. It knows that the <code>@post</code> object is of the <code>Post</code> class (again, we assume) and it
checks to see if the object is persisted. If it is, then it will use <code>post_path(@post)</code>. If it’s not, then <code>posts_path</code>.</p>

<p>The <code>form_for</code> method itself checks to see if the object passed in is persisted also, and if it is then it’ll default to a <code>PUT</code> HTTP
method, otherwise a <code>POST</code>.</p>

<p>So this is how <code>form_for</code> can be flexible enough to have an identical syntax on both a <code>new</code> and <code>edit</code> view. It’s becoming more and
more common these days for people to even put their whole <code>form_for</code> tags into a single partial and include it in both the <code>new</code> and
<code>edit</code> pages.</p>

<h3 id="a-more-complex-form">A more complex form</h3>

<p>So <code>form_for</code> is fairly simple for when you pass a normal object, but what happens if you pass an array of objects? Like this, for
instance:</p>

<pre><code class="language-erb">&lt;%= form_for [@post, @comment] do |f| %&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Well, both <code>url_for</code> and <code>form_for</code> have you covered there too.</p>

<p>The <code>url_for</code> method detects that this is an array and separates out each part and inspects them individually. First, what is this
<code>@post</code> thing? Well, in this case let’s assume it’s a <code>Post</code> instance that <em>is</em> persisted and has the id of 1. Second, what is this
<code>@comment</code> object? It’s a <code>Comment</code> instance that has not yet been persisted to the database.</p>

<p>What <code>url_for</code> will do here is build up the URL helper method piece by piece by placing each part in an array, joining it into a routing method and then calling that routing method with the necessary arguments.</p>

<p>First, it knows that the <code>@post</code> object is of the <code>Post</code> class and is persisted, therefore the URL helper will begin with <code>post</code>. Second, it knows that the <code>@comment</code> object is of the <code>Comment</code> class and is <em>not</em> persisted, and therefore <code>comments</code> will follow <code>post</code> in the URL helper build. The parts that <code>url_for</code> now knows about are <code>[:post, :comments]</code>.</p>

<p>The <code>url_for</code> method combines these individual parts with an underscore, so that it becomes <code>post_comments</code> and then appends <code>_path</code>
to the end of that, resulting in <code>post_comments_path</code>. Then it passes in just the persisted objects to the call to that method, resulting in a call like this:</p>

<pre><code>post_comments_path(@post)
</code></pre>

<p>Calling that method results in this:</p>

<pre><code>"/posts/1/comments"
</code></pre>

<p>Best part? <code>form_for</code> will still know to use <code>POST</code> if the <code>@comment</code> object is not a persisted object, and <code>PUT</code> if it is. A good
thing to remember is that the <code>form_for</code> is always for the <em>last</em> object specified in the array. The objects prior to it are just its
nesting, nothing more.</p>

<p>The more objects that are added, the more times <code>url_for</code> will do the hard yards and build the path out… although I recommend that
you keep it to just two parts.</p>

<h3 id="a-symbolic-form">A symbolic form</h3>

<p>Now that we’ve covered using an array containing objects for <code>form_for</code>, let’s take a look at another common use. An array containing
at least one Symbol object, like this:</p>

<pre><code class="language-erb">&lt;%= form_for [:admin, @post, @comment] do |f| %&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>What the <code>url_for</code> method does here is very simple. It sees that there’s a <code>Symbol</code> and takes it as it is. The first part of the
<code>url</code> will simply be the same as the symbol: <code>admin</code>. The URL that <code>url_for</code> knows of at this point is just <code>[:admin]</code>.</p>

<p>Then <code>url_for</code> goes through the remaining parts of the array. In this case, let’s assume both <code>@post</code> and <code>@comment</code> are persisted
and that they have the ids of 1 and 2 respectively. Same classes as before. <code>url_for</code> then adds <code>post</code> to the URL that it’s building,
and <code>comment</code> too, resulting in <code>[:admin, :post, :comment]</code>.</p>

<p>Then the joining happens, resulting in a method of <code>admin_post_comment_path</code>, and because both <code>@post</code> and <code>@comment</code> are persisted here,
they’re passed in, resulting in this method call:</p>

<pre><code class="language-ruby">admin_post_comment_path(@post, @comment)
</code></pre>

<p>Which (usually) turns into this path:</p>

<pre><code>/admin/posts/1/comments/2
</code></pre>

<h3 id="testing-routes-in-the-rails-console">Testing routes in the Rails console</h3>

<p>Rails provides a way to test out these routes in the <code>rails console</code>, through its <code>app</code> helper.</p>

<p>If we want to test out our <code>post_path</code> helper, we can do it with this call in the <code>rails console</code>:</p>

<pre><code class="language-ruby">app.post_path(1)
# =&gt; /posts/1
</code></pre>

<p>If we wanted to test out something more complex, like what <code>redirect_to @post</code> might return, we can invoke <code>url_for</code>:</p>

<pre><code class="language-ruby">post = Post.first
app.url_for(post)
# =&gt; /posts/1
</code></pre>

<p>This will also work with an array of objects:</p>

<pre><code class="language-ruby">post = Post.first
comment = post.comments.first
app.url_for([post, comment])
# =&gt; /posts/1/comments/2
</code></pre>

<p>And also if we use the array with a symbol inside it:</p>

<pre><code class="language-ruby">post = Post.first
comment = post.comments.first
app.url_for([:admin, post, comment])
# =&gt; /admin/posts/1/comments/2
</code></pre>

<h3 id="working-with-weirdly-named-routes">Working with weirdly named routes</h3>

<p>If you have routes that do not match their model names within the application, then you’re going to run into trouble with <code>url_for</code> and friends.</p>

<p>Let’s imagine you’ve got routes like this:</p>

<pre><code class="language-ruby">resources :posts, as: :articles
</code></pre>

<p>You will not be able to use things like:</p>

<pre><code class="language-ruby">link_to @post.title, @post
</code></pre>

<p>Or:</p>

<pre><code class="language-ruby">redirect_to @post
</code></pre>

<p>This is because the routing helper that we will need for this is called <code>article_path</code>, and not <code>post_path</code>. The inferrence of the route from the model name will break in this particular usage of <code>link_to</code>.</p>

<p>If you are unable to change the routes themselves to correct this difference, the way around it is to use a different syntax. This one:</p>

<pre><code class="language-ruby">link_to @post.title, [:article, id: @post.id]
</code></pre>

<p>We can test this in our console too by using <code>app.url_for</code> again:</p>

<pre><code class="language-ruby">post = Post.first
app.url_for([:article, id: post.id])
</code></pre>

<p>The way this work is that it sees that the first element is a symbol called <code>:article</code>, and so it infers that the start of the routing helper is <code>article_</code>. Then, given that there’s no more symbols, it builds a routing helper called <code>article_url</code>. The final element of the array is then passed as an argument to this method, finishing up as this method call:</p>

<pre><code class="language-ruby">article_url(id: post.id)
</code></pre>

<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>

<p>You can use the array form of polymorphic routing with the <code>redirect_to</code>, <code>link_to</code>, <code>form_for</code> and <code>form_with</code> methods. There’s probably other
methods that I’m not remembering right now that can do it too… it’s generally anything in Rails that would normally take a URL.</p>

<p>There’s no need to build your URLs in any Rails version greater-than 2 using hashes; that’s pretty old school. If you see cases like this in your applications, attempt a refactoring!</p>

<p>Experiment with your new knowledge of polymorphic routing and use it to the best of your advantage.</p>
