          <p>A few months ago I got in contact with Adam Thorsen who owns the http://loglibrary.com domain. He used to host the log files for the #rubyonrails channel on it, but stopped doing due to lack of time / whatever. So I wrote a bot over a couple of weekends and a parser (<a href="http://github.com/radar/logga-parser">later written in python</a>) for the logs from <a href="http://thesaq.com/rubyonrails">radsaq’s logs</a>. This was hosted through Adam’s contacts at EngineYard. EngineYard’s hosting was solid as and whenever there was an error they would contact us explaining what it was and how to fix it.</p>

<p>This all worked perfectly up until about a month ago when I started to receive “threats” that due to the global economic catastrophuck (<a href="http://elevensoft.com">thanks to Andy Wright for that word</a>) I would have to start paying for the hosting on the EngineYard service. Also, the site I made for it wasn’t receiving a high enough volume. I have too many side projects (rboard, lookup and Ruby 1.9 compatibility to name a few) that I need to get rid of some. This is one of them. If someone else would like to take over the logging and site part of “logga” I would be more than happy to hand this over. From today until further notice I will be hosting the bot in “helpa”-mode on my slicehost until someone else steps up. Thanks for your support for this project.</p>
