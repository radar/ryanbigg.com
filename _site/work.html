    <h2>I am currently looking for work.</h2>

    <p class="large">
      I have just finished working at <a href='https://covidence.org'>Covidence</a>.
    </p>

    <p class="large">
      My role there was as a senior
      full-stack developer, leading efforts across the codebase ranging from compiling a design system in React, CSS &
      TypeScript, to working with legacy code in a Ruby on Rails application.
    </p>

    <p class="large">
      I'm looking for remote work (in Australia) to start in January.

    <hr />

    <p>
      Prior to Covidence, I worked at Coder Academy where I taught junior developers the ropes of development, including
      HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Ruby.
    </p>

    <hr />

    <p>
      Prior to Coder Academy, I worked at Culture Amp where I ran a Junior Engineering Program (JEP) for 2
      years, training two groups of junior developers -- about 20 people in total. I
      enjoyed this job so much that I would really love the opportunity to do
      something like that again at another company. You can read my
      <a href="/2018/08/culture-amp-junior-engineering-program-retrospective">
        JEP #1: Retrospective
      </a>
      and <a href="/2019/03/jep-2-first-8-weeks">JEP #2: The First 8 Weeks</a> to
      get a feel for the kind of work I accomplished during the running of the JEP.
    </p>

    <hr />

    <p>
      Before the JEP, I worked for over a decade in plenty of different spaces:
      developer relations, ecommerce and internet-of-things. I've been working with
      teams large and small, writing in languages and frameworks such as React (with TypeScript), Ruby on Rails, Elixir
      and
      Go.
    </p>

    <p>
      Alongside my regular full time work, I have have also written
      <a href="/books">almost 10 books on Ruby and Elixir</a> over my career that
      have combined sales of over 15,000 copies.

    <h3>My Ideal Role</h3>

    <p>
      I <em>loved</em> mentoring junior developers at Coder Academy and at Culture Amp. What mattered to
      me here is that I felt like I was making a difference in developers' lives,
      and I was consistently supported in whatever I wanted to accomplish. This is
      my happy place.
    </p>

    <p>
      Working on a team where I could mentor and grow the developers around me while we build applications is <em>my
        zone</em>.
    </p>

    <p>
      (Or if someone was to pay me to mentor juniors <em>and</em> write books
      full-time then I'd be up for that too!) But that's probably edging on wishful thinking!
    </p>

    <h4>FAQ</h4>

    <p>
      <strong>Q: Would you like to relocate to [insert destination here]?</strong>
      No. I want to stay here in Warrnambool, Australia and continue to work from this
      great city. I am not interested in relocating at the moment. Commuting to Melbourne is out of the question too --
      it's
      a 4hr trip one way.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Q: We do onboarding for [a number] of weeks in our [remote] office. Would
        that be okay with you?</strong>
      No. See above.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Q: Would you like to work with our team that is US-remote only? You would
        be our first remote hire.</strong>
      I'd prefer not to at this stage. I did this previously and found the feedback
      loop really long. I would prefer to keep working with companies that have an
      AU presence, even if that's just a team of developers instead of a full
      office.
    </p>
