    <h2>I am currently looking for my next contract gig.</h2>

    <p class="large">
      My current contract is with <a href='https://oculo.com.au'>Oculo</a> on a two-person team building and maintaining
      <a href='https://keepsight.org.au/'>keepsight.org.au</a>. This project aims to remind people with diabetes in
      Australia to get regular eye tests to prevent vision loss. This is a Ruby on Rails application with a frontend
      primarily built in Tailwind, React and TypeScript.
    </p>

    <p class="large">
      The second part of this contract is helping Oculo build a subscription billing system with Stripe to replace a
      manual billing process for the users of their application.
    </p>

    <p class="large">
      This contract is wrapping up on the <span class="highlight">6th August</span>, and I'll be looking for work to
      <span class="highlight">start 9th August</span> or
      very soon after. I'm available for <span class="highlight">up to 4 days a week</span>.
    </p>

    <p class="large">I can only work <span class="highlight">remotely</span> from Warrnambool, Australia.</p>

    <h2>My Ideal Role</h2>

    <p class="large">
      Working on a team where I can mentor and grow the developers around me while we build applications is <em>my
        zone</em>.
    </p>

    <p class="large">
      While it's all fun and good to write the code <em>myself</em>, I definitely prefer doing that while helping
      upskill people around me. Be that through pair programming, writing technical documentation or reviewing their
      work.
    </p>

    <p class="large">
      I love writing TypeScript-powered React code, but can sling production-level code in any of TypeScript, React,
      GraphQL, CSS, JavaScript, Ruby, Rails, Elixir or Go.
    </p>

    <p>I care a lot about how <strong>the work gets done</strong>, from card kickoffs to retrospectives to developer
      tooling to deployment times. I love the approach of Kaizen: continual improvement of business processes to stream
      line how work is done.</p>

    <p>
      Overall: I want to help whatever team I join to ship great work and to improve ourselves and the business while we
      do it.
    </p>

    <h2>History</h2>

    <h3>Feb '21 -> Ongoing &mdash; Freelance contractor</h3>

    <p class="large">
      Working as a part-time "mercenary for hire" across a variety of tech stacks, but primarily focussing on
      Typescript-based React with Ruby on Rails backends.
    </p>

    <p>
      To share my knowledge, I write <a href='/books'>books about tech</a>. I sometimes overly-procrastinate on that by
      tinkering with my custom-made <a href='https://github.com/radar/twist-v2'>TypeScript / React / Hanami / GraphQL
        book review tool</a>.
    </p>



    <h3>December '08 &rarr; Current &mdash; Tech Book Author</h3>

    <p class="large">
      I have contributed extensively to documentation for Ruby and Rails. I started
      writing documentation for Rails in December 2008. The two guides I am best
      known for are the
      <a href="http://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html">Getting Started guide</a>
      and
      <a href="http://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_querying.html">Active Record Querying guide</a>. I also wrote
      the
      <a href="http://guides.rubyonrails.org/engines.html">Engines guide</a> and the
      <a href="http://guides.rubyonrails.org/asset_pipeline.html">Asset Pipeline guide</a>.
    </p>

    <p class="large">
      During 2010, I was contacted by <a href="https://manning.com">Manning</a> to
      write a book for them called
      <a href="manning.com/books/rails-3-in-action">Rails 3 in Action</a>. This
      subsequently went on to produce a second edition, called
      <a href="https://manning.com/books/rails-4-in-action">Rails 4 in Action</a>.
    </p>

    <p class="large">
      After the success of
      <a href="http://manning.com/books/rails-4-in-action">Rails 3 and Rails 4 in Action</a>
      I decided to strike out on my own and become a self-published author. I do
      this through <a href="https://leanpub.com">Leanpub</a> and have published <strong>seven</strong>
      books:

    <ul>
      <li><a href='https://leanpub.com/rails'>Active Rails</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://leanpub.com/multi-tenancy-rails-2">Multitenancy with Rails</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://leanpub.com/toyrobot">Toy Robot walkthrough, in Ruby</a> and another one in <a
          href="https://leanpub.com/elixir-toyrobot">Elixir</a></li>
      <li><a href='https://leanpub.com/maintain-rails'>Maintainable Rails</a></li>
      <li><a href='https://joyofelixir.com'>Joy of Elixir</a></li>
      <li><a href='https://leanpub.com/apollo-handbook'>The Apollo Handbook</a></li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      You can read more about these books over on

    <p class="large">
      My role at Covidence was as a senior full-stack developer, leading efforts across the codebase ranging from
      compiling
      a design system in React, CSS & TypeScript to standardise the different components across our application.
    </p>

    <p>
      I worked on a re-work of one of Covidence's major features called "Extraction", and was part of the team that
      launched (and maintained) Extraction 2.0.

      December '19 &rarr; April '20 &mdash;

    </h3>

    <p class="large">
      <a href="http://coderacademy.edu.au">Coder Academy</a> runs bootcamps for first-time developers, with the aim of
      getting them into their first ever developer job.
    </p>

    <p class="large">
      At Coder Academy I was the Lead Educator for the Code Like a Girl cohort. I was training a group of 14
      junior-junior
      developers in Ruby on Rails. I was then made redundant in this role due to the impact of COVID.
    </p>

    <p>
      Alongside this work, I was also working in a small team to improve the curriculum for Coder Academy across all of
      their campuses and bootcamps, focussing primarily on Computer Science Fundamentals, Ruby on Rails and JavaScript
      curriculum.

      August '16 &rarr; November '19 &mdash;
      <a href="http://cultureamp.com">Culture Amp</a>
    </h3>

    <p class="large">
      <a href="http://cultureamp.com">Culture Amp</a> aims to improve the culture of
      companies around the world.
    </p>

    <p class="large">
      From August 2017 until November 2019, I was the Junior Engineering Program Lead at Culture Amp.
      This job involved recruiting and mentoring junior engineers in Ruby and
      JavaScript (and lots more!) with the goal of training them up to be the next
      great engineers at Culture Amp and in the wider developer community.
    </p>

    <p class="large">
      My work at Culture Amp prior to being the JEP Lead, involved working as a
      Senior Developer with a small (~5-8 people) team of developers to maintain our
      large Rails monolith and to write event-sourced microservices in Elixir, along
      with frontends in React, and associated tech.
    </p>

    <p>
      The role of Junior Engineering Program lead was made redundant at the end of 2019 and I chose to take a redundancy
      payout rather than continue in a different role.
    </p>

    <p>
      I loved working at Culture Amp because I got to do what I love: mentor and grow
      junior developers. I also get lots of opportunities to help out other
      developers by working with them on difficult issues.
