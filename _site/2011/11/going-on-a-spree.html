        <small>03 Nov 2011</small><br>
        <p>When I was in America, I had the pleasure of talking to a lot of Americans. Americans are fun. As soon as they
hear the Australian accent they say something along the lines of &quot;Oh, you&#39;re from Australia?! I <em>love</em>
Australia!&quot;.</p>

<p>While I was there, I was thinking that there&#39;s just <em>so much</em> work out in the world. So many people doing super
interesting things. I started to think that perhaps I should take a break from &quot;shotgun consulting&quot; again, but
only if I could find one thing that I was super passionate about.</p>

<p>I was courted by so many different companies when I was at GoGaRuco and Strangeloop and while I was in Chicago.
Stuff ranging from a joking &quot;Screw those guys, come work for us!&quot; to more serious &quot;We&#39;ll do whatever it takes you
get you on board&quot;. You know what&#39;s a really good feeling? Being wanted. It&#39;s so <em>amazing</em>. So thanks to those
companies and their employees for their offers.</p>

<p>While I was in Chicago, I got into some serious-type discussions with two companies. One of them was Groupon,
where I sat for about a week doing work remotely for RubyX. I think they have an amazing team at Groupon
(including people like Bo Jeanes, who I am very good friends with), but it&#39;s
a bit too large for what I wanted to do.</p>

<p>On the very same day that these serious-type discussions happened with Groupon, the same kind of discussions
started with a slightly smaller company called <a href='http://spreecommerce.org'>Spree Commerce</a>. Sean and I started
talking about a Community Manager position that he wanted to fill, a position that involves full-time open source
work and talking with members of the community seeing to their needs. Spree has <a href='http://techcrunch.com/2011/10/10/spree-raises-1-5-million-from-true-ventures-aol-for-open-source-ecommerce-platform/'>$1.1 million</a> dollars of funding, which will go into some pretty exciting projects.</p>

<p>That is precisely the thing I am passionate about: making a product and the community around it <em>better</em>. Spree has a great platform and it will only get better with time.</p>

<p>For instance, we have <a href='http://groups.google.com/group/spree-user/msg/af44fbdb7e401b8e'>just undertaken work to move all of Spree&#39;s functionality into a namespace</a>. This will be merged back into the<code>master</code> branch next week. This means that if you want to have a <code>Product</code> model in your application and still want to use Spree&#39;s then that&#39;s entirely possible. I go into more information in <a href='http://groups.google.com/group/spree-user/msg/af44fbdb7e401b8e'>this lengthy post on the Google Group</a> about what the namespacing means.</p>

<p>I&#39;m excited to start officially at Spree next week and I wish RubyX all the best for their future endeavours. If
you want a crack team people to build your Rails application, RubyX is that team.</p>
