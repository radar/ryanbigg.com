            <p>So I've been thinking a lot recently about the changes in Rails 3.1, particularly the asset pipelining stuff, engines and how magical precisely gems are. I'm combining these last two into a <a href='http://github.com/radar/forem'>kick-ass forum engine for Rails 3.1</a> that you may have heard about already. Its name is a terrible pun and I am proud of it. I do like puns.</p>
<p>Anyway, asset pipelining! So I wanted to add theming support to forem because it's butt-ugly right now and I can't design for crap. Have you seen this blog? I wanted to make theming so dead-simple for forem that people just need to put one or two lines in their application and <em>BLAMMO</em> it would work.</p>
<p>I have accomplished this goal tonight, in what was probably about 10 minutes of thinking, experimenting and saying &quot;wow, I can't believe it works&quot; when it actually worked. To make theming work on forem, it's as simple as putting this line in your <code>Gemfile</code> (<em>after</em> the <code>forem</code> gem, as it needs to be loaded first):</p>
<pre><code>gem 'forem-theme-base', :git =&gt; &quot;git://github.com/radar/forem-theme-base&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>This gem is actually its own Rails engine, which means that it gets all the goodies that a Rails engine is bestowed, including the automatic hooks to the asset pipelining. This gem also contains this line:</p>
<pre><code>Forem::Engine.theme = :base
</code></pre>
<p>This (obviously) tells forem what theme to use, and can be overriden at your wish if you had multiple themes. I am considering having a settings panel for this in the backend.</p>
<p>To actually style the forum you'll need to put this line in the layout that forem uses:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;%= forum_theme_tag %&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>I would make this happen automatically, but other people may wish to apply their site's styles to the forum system without having to create another gem, and so I leave this as optional. This little tag generates a <code>stylesheet_link_tag</code> like this:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;%= stylesheet_link_tag &quot;assets/forem/base/style.css&quot; %&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Rails then will know where to serve this from because <code>forem-theme-base</code> is an engine.</p>
<p>Dead simple, and utterly amazing. Rails 3.1 is awesome.</p>
