   <title>Converting from WordPress to Jekyll</title>
   <link href="http://ryanbigg.com/2010/12/converting-from-wordpress-to-jekyll"/>
   <updated>2010-12-27T00:00:00+10:00</updated>
   <id>http://ryanbigg.com/2010/12/converting-from-wordpress-to-jekyll</id>
   <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday I converted this blog from WordPress to Jekyll, thanks to some prompting from <a href='http://twitter.com/lenary'>Sam Elliott</a> and <a href='http://twitter.com/rohitarondekar'>Rohit Arondekar</a>. All in all, the process wasn&#8217;t actually all that painful. What triggered this whole thing was three factors:</p>

<ul>
<li>My Slicehost server crashed, possibly due to some intense load I was getting from the <a href='http://ryanbigg.com/2010/12/ubuntu-ruby-rvm-rails-and-you'>Ubuntu, Ruby, RVM, Rails and You</a> post I wrote (whilst under the influence of delicious cider).</li>

<li>When the server rebooted, I was unable to boot Apache2 back up because <em>somebody</em> (read: me) had fucked with sqlite3 to try to get his IRC bot to work on the server.</li>

<li>Slicehost charged me $38/month for a 512MB box. Linode charges about half that for the same thing. Fuck Slicehost.</li>
</ul>

<p>So off I went on a magical journey to fix these three problems.</p>

<h3 id='never_work_on_live_systems'>Never work on live systems</h3>

<p>A rule that every developer has to learn the hard way (be it from anywhere to their own system up to a website with a couple of hundred users) is that you <strong>never ever, ever, ever work on live systems because something will go terribly, terribly wrong</strong>. The second rule that every developer learns is <strong>backups, motherfucker, do you have them?</strong>. So when I had 3 years of posts that I didn&#8217;t want to lose I obeyed these two rules.</p>

<h3 id='wordpress_conversion'>Wordpress conversion</h3>

<p>First task was to take an SQL backup from the WordPress install that I had and move it over to my own system. Next, I imported this SQL into a local install of MySQL and made sure it was the latest-and-greatest. Sure, enough it was. Rohit had pointed me at the <a href='https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/wiki/blog-migrations'>Blog migrations wiki page</a> for Jekyll and it had what appeared to be clear instructions for WordPress there.</p>

<p>So I cloned the <a href='http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll'>Jekyll</a> project into my <code>~/Sites/gems</code> folder and ran just the wordpress commands because I have tunnel vision when reading documentation (note: not my real username and password):</p>

<pre><code>$ export DB=ryanbigg
$ export USER=lolno 
$ export PASS=nopass4u 
$ ruby -r &#39;~/Sites/gems/jekyll/lib/jekyll/migrators/wordpress&#39; -e &#39;Jekyll::WordPress.process( &quot;#{ENV[&quot;DB&quot;]}&quot;, &quot;#{ENV[&quot;USER&quot;]}&quot;, &quot;#{ENV[&quot;PASS&quot;]}&quot;)&#39;</code></pre>

<p>To my surprise, it worked. I had a whole bunch of <code>_posts</code> files representing the posts in my system.</p>

<h3 id='booting_jekyll'>Booting Jekyll</h3>

<p>I installed the <code>jekyll</code> gem itself using <code>gem install jekyll</code> and then ran <code>jekyll --server</code> and it threw up a ton of &#8220;errors&#8221;, which actually turned out to be warnings about my ability to sometimes intersperse invalid HTML / Markdown with valid Markdown (or the other way around). When I went to http://localhost:4000 I got a 403 error. So I checked out other Jekyll blogs like <a href='http://github.com/qrush/litanyagainstfear'>Nick Quaranto's litanyagainstfear repository</a> to see what I was missing. I instantly came across the <a href='https://github.com/qrush/litanyagainstfear/blob/master/index.html'>index.html</a> file in this repository and &#8220;borrowed&#8221; it for my own blog, turning it into <a href='https://github.com/radar/ryanbigg.com/blob/master/index.html'>what's now here</a>. I choose to only show the last 25 posts because everything before that is ancient history. The links to them will still work, but I&#8217;m just not showing them in the archive list to conserve space.</p>

<h3 id='stylin'>Stylin&#8217;</h3>

<p>The next thing I needed to do was to create a <a href='https://github.com/radar/ryanbigg.com/blob/master/_layouts/default.html'>default.html layout</a> file in the <code>_layouts</code> folder to style this new home page of mine. I created a <code>css</code> folder at the root of the project and put in <a href='https://github.com/radar/ryanbigg.com/blob/master/css/style.css'>`style.css`</a> and got to work styling it. I wanted something a little more lightweight than the old theme and I think what I came up with was alright. This morning I added a <a href='https://github.com/radar/ryanbigg.com/blob/master/css/mobile.css'>`mobile.css`</a> which should format the blog just fine for mobile screens. It looks great on my iPhone 4.</p>

<h3 id='comments'>Comments</h3>

<p>I wanted to keep the comments from the WordPress site and Rohit recommended Disqus as a way to do that. I installed the <a href='http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/disqus-comment-system/'>WordPress plugin</a> for it and followed the bouncing ball and had my comments exported to Disqus in no time. I needed to add the following to the <a href='https://github.com/radar/ryanbigg.com/blob/0c30ab8b5b9721b16fa125d94270d797d4eb556e/_layouts/post.html#L16-30'>post layout</a> to support the Disqus comment system. The <code>wordpress_id</code> field is the &#8220;secret sauce&#8221; here for how Disqus knows which post links up to what comments. The only caveat I&#8217;ve been informed about for Disqus is that the comments won&#8217;t be indexed by Google because they&#8217;re loaded via a JavaScript request, but I can tolerate that. Any useful information I would put in a post, probably.</p>

<h3 id='wordpress_pages'>WordPress pages</h3>

<p>To convert over the pages from WordPress that weren&#8217;t posts I&#8217;ve copied the source of them (such as the <a href='http://ryanbigg.com/about-me.html'>About me</a> page) and put them as static HTML files in the root of the project. When Jekyll compiles the site, these are copied over to the <code>_site</code> directory.</p>

<h3 id='deployment'>Deployment</h3>

<p>Currently going via the low-tech method of an SSH + <code>git pull</code> on the server, but hoping to switch to a commit hook in the future.</p>

<h3 id='benefits'>Benefits</h3>

<p>The benefits are many. My posts are now <a href='http://github.com/radar/ryanbigg.com'>open source</a> which means that if people find problems with them that can send in pull requests, but that&#8217;s just a pipe dream probably.</p>

<p>The main benefit is the speed. On the vanilla WordPress install I had I was lucky to get 2 requests per second for the home page. With Jekyll, I&#8217;m getting about 2,300 reqests per second. This is due to the fact all my posts are static assets now. I think I could double this if I <a href='http://ryanbigg.com/2009/06/how-to-make-your-rails-application-578-times-faster/'>switched to Nginx</a>, which I plan on doing when I don&#8217;t have a use for the PHP version anymore.</p>

<p>I also get to write my posts the way I like to: Markdown + HTML. No crummy little editor window, I can do it all from within TextMate.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m really liking Jekyll as lightweight alternative to WordPress and it&#8217;s great to finally be off a PHP-based system. I mean, if Ruby is so good <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_Invented_Here'>why would I be using a PHP based system?</a></p>}]]></content>

   <title>Ubuntu, Ruby, RVM, Rails, and You</title>
   <link href="http://ryanbigg.com/2010/12/ubuntu-ruby-rvm-rails-and-you"/>
   <updated>2010-12-25T00:00:00+10:00</updated>
   <id>http://ryanbigg.com/2010/12/ubuntu-ruby-rvm-rails-and-you</id>
   <content type="html"><![CDATA[<strong>This beginner's guide will set up with Ruby 1.9.2, RVM and Rails 3.0.3 and is specifically written for Ubuntu 10.10, but will probably work on many other operating systems. YMMV.</strong><h2>Under no circumstance should you install Ruby, Rubygems or any Ruby-related packages from apt-get. This system is out-dated and leads to major headaches. Avoid it for Ruby-related packages. We do Ruby, we know what's best. Trust us.</h2>
<p>Still not convinced? <a href='http://news.ycombinator.org/item?id=2039438'>Read this</a>.</p>

<p>This guide will go through installing the <a href='http://rvm.beginrescueend.com'>RVM (Ruby Version Manager)</a>, then a version of Ruby (1.9.2), then <a href='http://rubyonrails.org'>Rails</a> and finally <a href='http://gembundler.com'>Bundler</a>.</p>

<p>By the end of this guide, you will have these things installed and have some very, very easy ways to manage gem dependencies for your different applications / libraries, as well as having multiple Ruby versions installed and usable all at once.</p>

<p>We assume you have <code>sudo</code> access to your machine, and that you have an understanding of the basic concepts of Ruby, such as &#8220;What is Rubygems?&#8221; and more importantly &#8220;How do I turn this computer-thing on?&#8221;. This knowledge can be garnered by reading the first chapter of <a href='http://manning.com/black2'>any Ruby book</a>.</p>
<h3>Housekeeping</h3>
<p>First of all, we&#8217;re going to run <code>sudo apt-get update</code> so that we have the latest sources on our box so that we don&#8217;t run into any package-related issues, such as not being able to install some packages.</p>

<p>Next, we&#8217;re going to install <a href='http://git-scm.org'>Git (a version control system)</a> and <code>curl</code> which are both required to install and use RVM, and <code>build-essential</code> which is required to compile Ruby versions, amongst other compilable things. To install these three packages we use this command:</p>

<pre><code>sudo apt-get install build-essential git-core curl</code></pre>
<h3>RVM</h3>
<p>RVM is a <a href='http://rvm.beginrescueend.com'>Ruby Version Manager</a> created by Wayne E. Seguin and is extremely helpful for installing and managing many different versions of Ruby all at once. Sometimes you could be working on a project that requires an older (1.8.7) version of Ruby but also need a new version (1.9.2) for one of your newer projects. This is a problem that RVM solves beautifully.</p>

<p>Another situation could be that you want to have different sets of gems on the same version of Ruby but don&#8217;t want to have to do deal with Gem Conflict Hell. RVM has <a href='http://rvm.beginrescueend.com/gemsets/basics/'>gemsets</a> for this. <strong>This is a feature you wouldn't have if you used the packaged Ruby</strong>.</p>

<p>We&#8217;re going to use it to install only one version of Ruby, but we can <a href='http://rvm.beginrescueend.com'>consult the documentation</a> if we want to install a different version of Ruby.</p>

<p>With <code>git-core</code> and <code>curl</code> installed we&#8217;ll be able to install RVM with this command:</p>

<pre><code>bash &lt; &lt;( curl http://rvm.beginrescueend.com/releases/rvm-install-head )</code></pre>

<p>The beautiful part of this is that it installs Ruby to our home directory, providing a sandboxed environment just for us.</p>

<p>Once that&#8217;s done, we&#8217;re going to need to add a line to <code>~/.bashrc</code> file (the file responsible for setting up our bash session) which will load RVM:</p>

<pre><code>echo &#39;[[ -s &quot;$HOME/.rvm/scripts/rvm&quot; ]] &amp;&amp; source &quot;$HOME/.rvm/scripts/rvm&quot;&#39; &gt;&gt; ~/.bashrc </code></pre>

<p>Then we&#8217;ll need to reload the <code>~/.bashrc</code> file which we can do with this small command:</p>

<pre><code>. ~/.bashrc</code></pre>

<p>The next command we run will tell us what other packages we need to install for Ruby to work:</p>

<pre><code>rvm notes
...
# For Ruby (MRI &amp; ree)  you should install the following OS dependencies:
ruby: aptitude install build-essential bison openssl libreadline6 libreadline6-dev
curl git-core zlib1g zlib1g-dev libssl-dev libyaml-dev libsqlite3-0
libsqlite3-dev sqlite3 libxml2-dev libxslt-dev autoconf</code></pre>

<p>A couple of these packages we&#8217;ve already installed, such as <code>git-core</code> and <code>curl</code>. They won&#8217;t be re-installed again.</p>

<p>These packages will lessen the pain when we&#8217;re working with Ruby. For example, the <code>libssl-dev</code> package will make OpenSSL support in Ruby work, <code>libsqlite3-0</code> and <code>libsqlite3-dev</code> are required for the <code>sqlite3-ruby</code> gem and the <code>libxml2-dev</code> and <code>libxslt-dev</code> packages are required for the <code>nokogiri</code> gem. Let&#8217;s install all these packages now using this command written all on a single line:</p>

<pre><code>sudo apt-get install build-essential bison openssl libreadline6 libreadline6-dev curl git-core zlib1g
zlib1g-dev libssl-dev libyaml-dev libsqlite3-0 libsqlite3-dev sqlite3 libxml2-dev libxslt-dev autoconf</code></pre>

<p>Now our Ruby lives will be as painless as possible.</p>
<h3>Ruby</h3>
<p>With RVM and these packages we can install Ruby 1.9.2:</p>

<pre><code>rvm install 1.9.2</code></pre>

<p>This command will take a couple of minutes, so grab your $DRINKOFCHOICE and go outside or something. Once it&#8217;s done, we&#8217;ll have Ruby 1.9.2 installed. To begin using it we can use this lovely command:</p>

<pre><code>rvm use 1.9.2</code></pre>

<p>Are we using 1.9.2? You betcha:</p>

<pre><code>ruby -v
ruby 1.9.2p136 (2010-12-25 revision 30365) [x86_64-linux]</code></pre>

<p>Or, even better, would be to make this the <em>default</em> for our user! Oooh, yes!</p>

<pre><code>rvm --default use 1.9.2</code></pre>

<p>Now whenever we open a new bash session for this user we&#8217;ll have Ruby available for us to use! Yay!</p>
<h3>Rails</h3>
<p>Now that RVM and a version of Ruby is installed, we can install Rails. Because RVM is installed to our home directory, we don&#8217;t need to use that nasty <code>sudo</code> to install things; we&#8217;ve got write-access! To install the Rails gem we&#8217;ll run this command:</p>

<pre><code>gem install rails</code></pre>

<p>This will install the <code>rails</code> gem and the other 22 gems that it and its dependencies depend on, including Bundler.</p>
<h3>MySQL</h3>
<p>If you&#8217;re planning on using the <code>mysql2</code> gem for your application then you&#8217;ll want to install the <code>libmysqlclient16-dev</code> package before you do that. Without it, you&#8217;ll get an error when the gem tries to compile its native extensions:</p>

<pre><code>Building native extensions.  This could take a while...
ERROR:  Error installing mysql2:
	ERROR: Failed to build gem native extension.

<h3>PostgreSQL</h3>
<p>Similar to the <code>mysql2</code> gem&#8217;s error above, you&#8217;ll also get an error with the <code>pg</code> gem if you don&#8217;t have the <code>libpq-dev</code> package installed you&#8217;ll get this error:</p>

<pre><code>    Building native extensions.  This could take a while...
ERROR:  Error installing pg:
	ERROR: Failed to build gem native extension.

/home/ryan/.rvm/rubies/ruby-1.9.2-p136/bin/ruby extconf.rb

*** extconf.rb failed ***
Could not create Makefile due to some reason, probably lack of
necessary libraries and/or headers.  Check the mkmf.log file for more
details.  You may need configuration options.</code></pre>
<h3>Fin.</h3>
<p>And that&#8217;s it! Now you&#8217;ve got a Ruby environment you can use to write your (first?) Rails application in with such minimal effort. A good read after this would be the <a href='http://guides.rubyonrails.org'>official guides for Ruby on Rails</a>. Or perhaps the documentation on the <a href='http://rvm.beginrescueend.com'>RVM site</a> which goes into using things such as <a href='http://rvm.beginrescueend.com/gemsets/basics/'>gemsets</a> and the exceptionally helpful <a href='http://rvm.beginrescueend.com/workflow/rvmrc/#project'>per-project .rvmrc file</a>. A quick way to generate an <code>.rvmrc</code> file is to run a command like this inside the project</p>

<pre><code>rvm use 1.9.2@rails3 --rvmrc</code></pre>

<p>RVM is such a powerful tool and comes in handy for day-to-day Ruby development. Use it, and not the packages from apt to live a life of development luxury.</p>

   <title>Rails routing and automatic assumptions</title>
   <link href="http://ryanbigg.com/2010/12/rails-routing-and-automatic-assumptions"/>
   <updated>2010-12-19T00:00:00+10:00</updated>
   <id>http://ryanbigg.com/2010/12/rails-routing-and-automatic-assumptions</id>
   <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Last night while working on chapter 12 for <a href='http://manning.com/katz'>Rails 3 in Action</a> I stumbled across an interesting problem detailed in <a href='https://gist.github.com/746414'>this gist</a>. The problem I was seeing is that the <code>edit_admin_user_path</code> route <em>was not</em> failing, while the <code>admin_user_permissions_path</code> path <em>was</em> failing.</p>

<p>I had my suspicions to why the first link worked and spent the remainder of last night digging through my favourite bit of Rails and Rails related source(ry): Action Dispatch and rack-mount. I didn&#8217;t figure it all completely out until after a good night&#8217;s sleep. It wasn&#8217;t until I saw pixeltrix&#8217;s comment on the Gist this morning that it all clicked.</p>

<p>I knew from a while ago that sometimes Rails will just <em>know</em> what to put as the <code>:id</code> part of a route and I never did bother questioning how that part of Rails works until last night. It turns out that Action Dispatch (and by extension, rack-mount) are very intelligent in the way that they build routes. Take the <code>edit_admin_user_path</code> route for example. This requires two parameters: <code>:account_id</code> and <code>:id</code>, representing an account and user object respectively. The routing code doesn&#8217;t <em>care</em> what arguments are passed in here, only the order of them. All it does is call <code>to_param</code> on the objects to extract the segments for the routes. So when you do this:</p>
<pre>
   edit_admin_user_path(@user)
</pre>
<p>But the order of the parameters in the URL are <code>:account_id</code> and then <code>:id</code>, Rails will assume that the first object is meant for the <code>:account_id</code> parameter. How does it work out the <code>:id</code> parameter then? It&#8217;s not passed into the helper, so instead it&#8217;s gathered from the current request&#8217;s parameters. Therefore, this helper generates a URL such as <code>/2/users/2/edit</code> inadvertently. We can change this to be simply:</p>
<pre>
   edit_admin_user_path
</pre>
<p>Then Rails will assume that we want the current <code>:account_id</code> and <code>:id</code> from the current request, making our code much shorter, compared to what we&#8217;d have to do if this feature didn&#8217;t exist:</p>
<pre>
  edit_admin_user_path(@account, @user)
</pre>
<p>The <code>admin_user_permissions_path(@user)</code> helper throws an error because it expects to receive both a <code>:account_id</code> and <code>:user_id</code> parameter. Without the <code>:user_id</code> parameter available or passed in to the helper, rack-mount won&#8217;t know how to generate this URL and will raise a &#8220;No route matches&#8221; error.</p>

<p>Oh, and I also <a href='http://twitter.com/ryanbigg/status/16104049640210432'>offered a free copy of Rails 3 in Action</a> to the person who helped me solve this issue, but it was really a team effort. alindeman, pixeltrix and pacsoe all get free, signed dead-tree copies when the book&#8217;s done. Thanks lads.</p>}]]></content>

   <title>Asking Questions The Right Way</title>
   <link href="http://ryanbigg.com/2010/12/asking-questions-the-right-way"/>
   <updated>2010-12-16T00:00:00+10:00</updated>
   <id>http://ryanbigg.com/2010/12/asking-questions-the-right-way</id>
   <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I spend a lot of time on <a href='http://stackoverflow.com/users/15245/ryan-bigg'>Stack Overflow</a> answering Ruby and Rails questions, but also venturing into other areas such as git or html and so on. I&#8217;ve answered over 400 questions on there and recently broke 8,000 reputation points. As of this posting, I&#8217;ve been there 32 days in a row.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s safe to say I&#8217;m a tad addicted.</p>

<p>I really enjoy answering <a href='http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4433823/testing-reject-if-in-anaf'>interesting questions</a> asked by the huge number of people who use the site, possibly mainly because I get a &#8220;reward&#8221; for it most of the time in that my reputation &#8220;score&#8221; increases when someone presses the upvote arrow or the accept checkmark. Or possibly also because I learn stuff like that model classes in Rails 3 have a <code>nested_attribute_options</code> method on them which allows access to the configuration for all <code>accepts_nested_attribute_for</code> in that model. Or possibly both.</p>

<p>What I don&#8217;t enjoy though is decrypting <a href='http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4456254/why-dont-i-get-a-method-error'>weird questions</a>. These questions usually follow the same MO. The user begins by declaring something vague like &#8220;my code isn&#8217;t working&#8221; and then follows it up with a &#8220;plz can any1 help?&#8221; or something similar. Sure, they&#8217;re probably new to the language. So it&#8217;s up to show them the proper way to ask a question for Ruby.</p>
<h3>Step 0: Smart questions</h3>
<p>Read of <a href='http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html'>"How to Ask Questions The Smart Way" by Eric Steven Raymond</a>. It pretty much covers every single possible permutation of asking a question. Follow this guide, and you cannot do any wrong.</p>
<h3>Step 1: Show us the code</h3>
<p>Generally when I help somebody solve the issue it&#8217;s good to get some background on how they got to that particular problem. For me, the best kind of background is some actual code. In most cases the problem is right there and obvious right away and just by looking at it anybody who knows the language should be able to help you solve it.</p>

<p>If it&#8217;s an IRC channel, a user can paste a single line of code into an IRC channel, but generally the preferred method is either a <a href='http://gist.github.com'>Gist</a> or a <a href='http://pastie.org'>Pastie</a> (when it&#8217;s up). Be sure to mention that you&#8217;re going to need the HTTP URL from those services, not the Git URL. Also, don&#8217;t encourage use of <a href='http://pastebin.org'>Pastebin</a>, because it&#8217;s got ugly syntax highlighting and there&#8217;s a pretty strong rumour going around that it may be Demonspawn.</p>
<h3>Step 2: Show us the stacktrace</h3>
<p>If the code doesn&#8217;t show the breakage clearly, then the next port of call is the stacktrace associated with the error. Again, <a href='http://gist.github.com'>Gist</a> or <a href='http://pastie.org'>Pastie</a> are perfect for these. Take <a href='https://gist.github.com/3a45806f5391505530a5'>this gist</a> for example. If the user shows just the first line of the error then we&#8217;d have no context to go on. The stacktrace provides that context and from that we can determine they&#8217;re using a deprecated-in-Rails-3 method and that they should probably delete that file.</p>
<h3>Step 3: Explain what is being attempted</h3>
<p>If all else fails, then perhaps there&#8217;s a bigger issue at hand. Perhaps the code can be designed in a better fashion. By talking over the issue with other people they may have unique views on how to do it in a better fashion. Talking through a tough problem with other people who have been there before is really the best way to work out what the right way to do it is.</p>

<p>With the <code>MethodError</code> StackOverflow question it would be helpful for a person wanting to help to know why that person wants a <code>MethodError</code> exception rather than a <code>NoMethodError</code> exception. What&#8217;s the end goal?</p>

<p>By seeing these three simple things, we as helpers are more enabled to help those who are asking for our help.</p>}]]></content>

   <id>http://ryanbigg.com/2010/12/the-writing-process</id>
   <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s been a while since I&#8217;ve videoblogged about the progress on Rails 3 in Action and I&#8217;m in that kind of mood tonight, but can&#8217;t be bothered turning on the light and setting up for that, so instead you&#8217;ll get it in text version.</p>

<p>This week on Tuesday, I caught up with Mark Ryall for lunch and he asked what the writing process was like. I explained it to him and that&#8217;s definitely not the first time I&#8217;ve explained it to somebody, but nevertheless still tried to make it sound interesting. There&#8217;s a couple of key points I&#8217;d like to use this post to go into greater detail about.</p>
<h3>There are no montages</h3>
<p>Ever seen Rocky I? It has a great training montage where through some clever cutting we see Rocky train for the big fight. He&#8217;s running through fields, drinking raw eggs, and finally climbing a huge flight of stairs and then &#8220;dancing&#8221; because he was victorious.</p>

<p>In the real world, there are no montages. I wake up in the morning and I think about how much I&#8217;d like to get done in a day. Sometimes I do that, sometimes I exceed expectation and sometimes I fail. But the main point is that I&#8217;m at least giving it a go, every single day. If I&#8217;m not writing, then I&#8217;m at least thinking about what I would write about, how the pieces all fit together. Perseverance is definitely a non-optional thing when it comes to writing a book. I focus on planning out a section and then writing it. Sometimes during the writing of it, I discover some oversight in a previous paragraph and jump back to fix it. If I don&#8217;t fix it, then I&#8217;ve got my awesome review team which will point out mistakes, which takes me on to my second point.</p>
<h3>Get a posse</h3>
<p>The review team so far have filed 870 notes for the book. Now, whilst this may seem like a lot, there&#8217;s a whole wall-o&#8217;-text there, some 130,000+ words so far. Many of these notes where stuff like places where I use &#8220;ran&#8221; rather than &#8220;run&#8221; or where sentences would have better wording. Then there were notes as well saying that the reviewer got lost in the text or that a code example is missing a character or overflows. Without these reviewers, I would not have been able to solve these notes as quickly as I have been, and I hope that they&#8217;ll stick with me until it&#8217;s over.</p>

<p>How do these reviewers file the notes? That&#8217;s the third point.</p>
<h3>The tools for writing a programming book, suck</h3>
<p>Surely, somebody has solved this issue. Unfortunately for myself, that somebody isn&#8217;t my publisher. I&#8217;m hand-writing the book in XML which goes a little like this:</p>
<pre>
&lt;informalexample id="ch12_152"&gt;
  &lt;programlisting id="ch12_153"&gt;
    &lt;![CDATA[create_table :accounts_users, :id =&gt; false do |t|
      t.string :account_id
      t.string :user_id
      t.boolean :admin, :default =&gt; false
    end
    
    remove_column :users, :admin
    ]]&gt;
  &lt;/programlisting&gt;
&lt;/informalexample&gt;
</pre>
<p>I&#8217;ve got TextMate macros for that so I just type <code>in[tab]</code> for it to generate the <code>informalexample</code> and nested <code>programlisting</code> tags, with the <code>id</code> attributes filled in at a later time by <a href='https://gist.github.com/737322'>a script I've written myself</a>. That in itself was an interesting problem to solve. Each and every single element in the document needs a unique ID, but you can&#8217;t just go ahead and number every single element in order: you have to be considerate of the fact that some elements may already have ids. If that&#8217;s the case, then you find the &#8220;biggest&#8221; id and just add +1 to that for every single new element.</p>

<p>Why do these elements need IDs? Because of how Manning&#8217;s review tool works. My editor and I both have access to a tool that we can log into and leave notes for the book. These notes relate to an element based on that element&#8217;s ID so even if the <em>content</em> of the element changes after the note has been left, we still know what element that refers to. The IDs for that particular system are something like <code>_432_4125_3843</code>, where the first number is the book id, the second number the chapter id and the third number the element number for that chapter. I prefer my naming schema, to be perfectly honest.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s a small problem with the tool my editor and I use: only we have access to it. For very good reason too. Anybody who has access to it gets to see every single other book written by Manning, which is probably not the best for security reasons there. Also, this tool requires me to use SVN (wherein a part of me dies every time that happens), as well as <a href='https://skitch.com/ryanbigg/rrxji/a'>an interface that is from many, many years ago.</a> To update a chapter, I must go into this interface and click on every chapter, scroll to the very bottom of the page, press the &#8220;Latest&#8221; radio button and press &#8220;Update&#8221;. Then once the request is done, I get no clear notification if something has gone wrong. It&#8217;s all very luck-based.</p>

<p>One Saturday, I got tired of doing this. I knew I could code something far, far greater. Hell, I was/am writing a book on Rails 3, why not build another Rails application to help in that process? That&#8217;s how Twist was born. On a single Saturday (ok, and some minor upkeep during some down time).</p>
<h3>Twist</h3>
<p>Twist is a Rails 3.0.3 application which currently has about 40 users. Each of these users can log into the system and leave notes for any element in any chapter and also see notes left by other users. Collaborative editing is the future, man. I can log into the system and see exactly what every other user sees, except I have one extra ability: I can close notes. Ideally I would like to have three stages for notes: Open, Complete and Closed so that people can check to see if the note is to their satisfaction, but I haven&#8217;t seen any large use for that yet. It&#8217;s just a nice-to-have.</p>

<p>So how does Twist get the book then? That Saturday was fever-pitch coding. I host the book on GitHub (quite probably my favourite online service that&#8217;s not a bank), and GitHub has Post-Receive Hooks which trigger when the repository is pushed to. With these, I can send a payload of a commit to any URL I desire. This payload contains information such as what files were added, modified or removed during the commits that have happened for that push. So that&#8217;s what Twist uses. It parses the payload, downloads the XML for the chapters and parses it all and stores it in a database structure that, simply put, goes like this:</p>
<pre>
  Book -&lt; Chapters -&lt; Revisions -&lt; Sections -&lt; Elements &gt;- Notes &gt;- Users
</pre>
<p>Every time I push a change to GitHub, it&#8217;s instantly available for the reviewers to see. No SVN or shitty interface bullshit. When reviewers visit a section it&#8217;s rendered right from the database. If it had a lot of traffic, sure, I&#8217;d cache it. It just doesn&#8217;t need it right now. One of my favourite features which I added recently was the ability to close notes through commit messages using a message such as &#8220;Fixed messed-up code sample - Finishes #711&#8221;, ala GitHub Issues. Oh, and <a href='https://skitch.com/ryanbigg/rrxkb/twist.ryanbigg.com-1.2.4'>it looks like this</a>. Hat-tip to Ben Hoskings for the protips on things like the line and paragraph spacing.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s one thing I haven&#8217;t been able to solve yet: testing the code samples.</p>
<h3>How do you know it works?</h3>
<p>One thing that bugs me with this writing process is that I have no solid clue if the code I&#8217;m writing actually works. A lo-fi way I&#8217;ve worked out of solving this is to write the code for the application as I&#8217;m writing the book. Make it work in the application and then it&#8217;s a matter of simply copying over the code from the application into the book. My main problem with that is that code and output can both change. I don&#8217;t know how yet to test this cleanly &#8211; and I&#8217;m pretty sure Manning&#8217;s XML format would prevent me from even trying &#8211; but I know it&#8217;s possible.</p>
<h3>Fin</h3>
<p>Anyway, long post is long and probably not that interesting to a normal reader. Still, it&#8217;s fascinating for me. The whole process gives me this fuzzy, warm feeling. Made some good progress on Chapter 12 today, and I think I&#8217;m going to go push that to GitHub (and by extension, Twist) right now. Bye!</p>}]]></content>

   <title>Commit it, or else!</title>
   <link href="http://ryanbigg.com/2010/12/commit-it-or-else"/>
   <updated>2010-12-09T00:00:00+10:00</updated>
   <id>http://ryanbigg.com/2010/12/commit-it-or-else</id>
   <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ve seen the same question pop up a couple of times now:</p>
<blockquote>
  Should I commit the Gemfile.lock file that Bundler generates?
</blockquote>
<p>Yes. Do it. Do it now if you haven&#8217;t already.</p>

<p>Another common question is:</p>
<blockquote>
  I always get conflicts in my db/schema.rb file, why should I commit that?
</blockquote>
<p>This post answers both.</p>
<h3>"Why should I commit Gemfile.lock?"</h3>
<p>When you run <code>bundle install</code> in your project, Bundler will download and install all the gems and their dependencies and their dependencies&#8217; dependencies (and so on) and then create a <code>Gemfile.lock</code> file based on what it installed.</p>

<p>This file is incredibly important because it lists all the precise versions of everything that your project uses at that point in time. Of course, it&#8217;s up to you to ensure that the project is actually working at this point&#8230; something that you should be doing before you commit the <code>Gemfile</code> <strong>and</strong> the <code>Gemfile.lock</code> files. Whenever somebody else clones this project (say, in a couple of days after your setup) and runs <code>bundle install</code>, they will get the <strong>exact same</strong> versions of the gems. Without <code>Gemfile.lock</code>, dependencies will be re-resolved and versions could have been updated during that time. This can lead to undesired outcomes.</p>

<p>Commit it, or else.</p>
<h3>"Why should I commit schema.rb?</h3>
<p>The <code>db/schema.rb</code> file in Rails plays a very similar role to that of the <code>Gemfile.lock</code>. Its purpose is to provide the schema for the database at the absolute latest point. This allows everybody who&#8217;s working on the project &#8211; regardless of what time they enter the project &#8211; to run <code>rake db:schema:load</code> to get the absolute latest schema.</p>

<p>Now note here that I <strong>don&#8217;t</strong> recommend running <code>rake db:migrate</code> to get the latest database schema. There&#8217;s a couple of reasons why people may think this is a good idea, but let me tell you right now: it isn&#8217;t. If you&#8217;re getting started on a project, use <code>rake db:schema:load</code> to get set up (after, of course, setting up the database).</p>

<p><code>rake db:migrate</code> will run <em>every single damn migration</em> in your project, creating tables in one &#8220;step&#8221; and then destroying them in a future step. This is an utter waste of time. <code>db/schema.rb</code> has the final outcome of it already there for you.</p>

<p>Also, if you&#8217;re using <code>rake db:migrate</code> to insert data into your database: don&#8217;t. Use <code>db/seeds.rb</code> for that.</p>

<p>On a similar train of thought: if you&#8217;re using migrations to execute queries that you can&#8217;t do using Rails helpers, perhaps that&#8217;s not such a good idea either. Think about it: the only way you&#8217;re going to be able to run those again on another machine is by running all the migrations again, which we&#8217;ve just established is a Terrible Idea. What may be less of a Terrible Idea is to have an alternative Rake task such as a <code>db:setup</code> script which runs <code>db:schema:load</code> and then executes those specific queries. Yes, it&#8217;s more files to maintain, but this would stop you from having to run <strong>all</strong> the migrations to get those specific queries to re-run. Migrations shouldn&#8217;t be used to do this kind of low-level activity; it just simply doesn&#8217;t fit.</p>

<p>As for the conflicts in <code>db/schema.rb</code>? You&#8217;re a programmer for crying out loud. Suck it up and deal with it. Or <a href='http://tbaggery.com/2010/10/24/reduce-your-rails-schema-conflicts.html'>code up a solution</a>, at least.</p>}]]></content>

   <title>Paths vs Subdomains</title>
   <link href="http://ryanbigg.com/2010/11/paths-vs-subdomains"/>
   <updated>2010-11-28T00:00:00+10:00</updated>
   <id>http://ryanbigg.com/2010/11/paths-vs-subdomains</id>
   <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Earlier today I put out <a href='http://twitter.com/ryanbigg/status/8747010869956608'>a tweet</a> which asked:</p>
<blockquote>
site.com/account (Github) or account.site.com (Basecamp) style for per-account URLs?
</blockquote>
<p>There were great arguments from both sides in the debate. Tweets like <a href='http://twitter.com/Sutto/status/8799294744170496'>Darcy Laycock's</a> and <a href='http://twitter.com/jms_/status/8770149087707137'>James Ottaway's</a>.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve decided to make it paths for two reasons.</p>
<h3>Easier to test</h3>
<p>Quite simply, paths (http://ticketee.com/account) are much easier to test by booting up <code>rails server</code> than subdomains are. They require no additional configuration by that means and they&#8217;re guaranteed to work on all systems.</p>

<p>Subdomains on the other hand would require use of another tool such as <a href='http://github.com/bjeanes/ghost'>Ghost</a> which would work on Ubuntu and Mac OS X, but not Windows. There is no One True Solution for everybody when it comes to subdomains. Since Rails 3 in Action is intentionally written without discrimination between operating systems, I would prefer this chapter to be no exception to that rule.</p>
<h3>Account sharing</h3>
<p>In the application I am going to be sharing users across accounts. A user that is created on one account, can be gifted access to an alternative account. This would result in an &#8220;open&#8221; system, and I think a path URL would be better for this than a subdomain URL.</p>

<p>Thank you all for your suggestions and the interesting discussions tonight. You&#8217;ve been amazing.</p>}]]></content>

   <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Last week I wrote a post called <a href='http://ryanbigg.com/2010/11/looking-for-sponsors/'>"Looking for Sponsors"</a> where I asked if anyone would be interested in donating to a project where I worked full-time on doing documentation for Rails.</p>

<p>After receiving a great response from it, I&#8217;m <a href='http://pledgie.com/campaigns/14034'>now officially taking donations</a> and <a href='http://docrails.uservoice.com/forums/88055-general'>suggestions on what to document</a>. After all, I want this to be a community-driven event.</p>

<p>I would like to start Monday.</p>

<p>As I say on the Pledgie, I&#8217;ve got some ideas already like finishing the <a href='http://guides.rubyonrails.org/initialization.html'>Initialization Internals Guide</a>, but really I&#8217;m leaving this in the hands of the very capable community.</p>

<p>So how about it? <a href='http://pledgie.com/campaigns/14034'>Give me a couple of dollars</a>, and I&#8217;ll give you some great documentation. Deal?</p>}]]></content>

   <id>http://ryanbigg.com/2010/11/looking-for-sponsors</id>
   <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Back in September I wrote a post called <a href='http://ryanbigg.com/2010/09/advanced-rails-documentation/'>"Advanced Rails Documentation"</a>, which talked about there being a dearth of advanced Ruby on Rails documentation about the place.</p>

<p>Since then, I&#8217;ve been talking with <strong>a lot</strong> of people in the Ruby world and that&#8217;s changed my opinion of what&#8217;s truly needed. It&#8217;s not so much the <em>advanced</em> documentation that&#8217;s needed, but more on the intermediate parts of Rails such as using application templates / builders, or even an Engines guide for when 3.1 drops. Piotr Sarnacki has been doing some seriously awesome work on those.</p>

<p>Another example, Railscamp was this weekend just gone. It was <strong> bloody great</strong>. During my time spent coding at it, I worked on investigating and documenting the <code>ActionDispatch::Routing::Mapper</code> class, in particular, most of the options for the methods such as <code>namespace</code> and <code>resources</code>. If you see anything wrong with the documentation of these methods, I&#8217;m probably your man to ask.</p>

<p>This is the kind of work that I&#8217;d be doing if I received sponsorship prior to January: working on guides and general documentation for Rails and its ecosystem. If you want examples of my work, you need not look any further than the blogs I&#8217;ve written here, as well as <a href='http://manning.com/katz'>Rails 3 in Action</a>, which is more a beginner-focussed text.</p>

<p>There was a <a href='http://pledgie.com/campaigns/34'>drive just like this back in 2006</a> and that was a resounding success. But back then, Rails was at 1.1.6! Rails has come quite a long way since then, and I think it&#8217;s time that we had some quality, community-sponsored documentation going on. I want to help the community, and I think this is the best way I can be of most use.</p>

<p>The intention of this post is to purely gauge the interest in a project like this. I&#8217;ll write another post during December with a link to a Pledgie (or similar). I&#8217;m more than happy to do it, but a man&#8217;s gotta eat. So my final question is: <strong>would you donate to a project like this, and how much (or what) would you donate?</strong></p>}]]></content>

   <title>The Rails 3 Upgrade</title>
   <link href="http://ryanbigg.com/2010/11/the-rails-3-upgrade"/>
   <updated>2010-11-07T00:00:00+10:00</updated>
   <id>http://ryanbigg.com/2010/11/the-rails-3-upgrade</id>
   <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>During the interim between GetUp and my-next-big-job I&#8217;ve spent the week at a place in Brisbane called <a href='http://ennova.com.au'>Ennova</a> hanging out with such talented people as <a href='http://twitter.com/ltw_'>Lucas Willett</a> and <a href='http://twitter.com/jasoncodes'>Jason Weathered</a>. During my brief stint I was <s>roped into</s> asked to help out with a Rails 3 upgrade. Here&#8217;s a semi-detailed list of what we did in order to upgrade the existing Rails 2.3.8 application to Rails 3.0.1.</p>
<h3>The Rails 3 Upgrade Handbook</h3><a href='http://railsupgradehandbook.com'>The Rails 3 Upgrade Handbook</a>
<p>I warn you now: this is a huge post (around 4,000 words). I think it contains a lot of good information that could probably help you or someone you know upgrade their application to Rails 3. It was 5 days effort upgrading this application to Rails 3 for two people, but a large majority of that time was spent fixing up the tests for the application as some were not that well-written. Most of the code is good code, though, and that&#8217;s really helpful when you&#8217;re doing something like this. In this post there&#8217;s only going to be mentions of things that are different for this particular application between Rails 2 and Rails 3 and the workflow we went through on each day during this effort.</p>

<p>Our plan of attack was to get at least <code>rails console</code> booting first, then make <code>rails console production</code> boot. Next, the application has both RSpec and test/unit tests as well as Cucumber features, so we chose to get the RSpec tests passing first, then the test/unit tests. If all of these tests passed then most of the Cucumber feature should fall in to place, as they did. The following task would be getting the Cucumber tests passing. During this whole process every time we came across a deprecation warning we would try to fix it.</p>
<h3>Bundler</h3>
<p>Before I came to Ennova they (like all smart / cool / awesome people I know) had already switched their 2.3.8 (I&#8217;m going to keep stressing this point) application over to using Bundler. It worked beautifully! If they hadn&#8217;t done this then we would have to install the &#8220;rails_upgrade&#8221; plugin using this line:</p>

<pre><code>script/plugin install git://github.com/rails/rails_upgrade.git</code></pre>

<p>And then run <code>rake rails:upgrade:gems</code> to switch the <code>config.gem</code> lines in the <em>config/environment(s)/<em>.rb_ files to <code>gem</code> lines in a <em>Gemfile</em>. There&#8217;s other commands that this plugin provides to which we should have used to upgrade our application in retrospect, but I think not using them didn&#8217;t slow us down</em>that* much. <a href='https://github.com/rails/rails_upgrade'>Check out the README here.</a></em></p>

<p>Because they&#8217;d already done this we began the process of upgrading to Rails 3 began with this line in the <em>Gemfile</em>:</p>
<pre>
  gem 'rails', '3.0.1'
</pre>
<p>Then we needed to run <code>bundle install</code> and then we were on our way.</p>
<h3>Monday</h3><strong>Partner: Lucas Willet</strong>
<p>Most of the upgrade process is a matter of &#8220;following the bouncing ball&#8221;. If we saw a deprecation warning, generally speaking it was explanatory enough that we were able to understand what it meant and then go about fixing it. The notes beneath are for those issues which were <em>not</em> purely deprecation warnings, but &#8220;gotchas&#8221;.</p>

<p>To &#8220;upgrade&#8221; the application, we begun by ensuring that everything was committed to a branch and that the application was stable. This application is a well-tested application (not 100% coverage, but getting there) and we assumed that if all the tests were passing on the 2.x version of the application then the goal to ensure that the Rails 3 application was upgraded is that all the tests should be passing too. If the application had any failing tests it would be priority #1 to fix these up before going through with the upgrade.</p>

<p>The application uses Git for version control so we checked out a new branch called &#8220;rails-3&#8221; and began our work. The next command we had to use was the <code>rails new .</code> from within the application itself which runs the Rails application generator on the current directory. This is where you have to be really careful that it doesn&#8217;t override things such as the <em>app/controllers/application.rb</em> file. If you&#8217;ve got version control then it&#8217;s quite easy to check out this file, but if you miss it then it&#8217;s difficult (as in, you&#8217;d have to generate another application and copy over the important bits) of a file if you press the wrong key during this part. Be very careful.</p>

<p>Our first test was to see if we could get <code>rails console production</code> running which would mean that the application was at least booting in production mode, then we would move on to getting the tests to pass. the &#8220;production&#8221; environment is very similar to the &#8220;test&#8221; environment and although we <em>could</em> have used the &#8220;test&#8221; environment, we wanted to make sure that all the production-environment code was running. When we ran this command, it bombed as expected. <strong>No upgrade is smooth.</strong></p>

<p>The first couple of errors we encountered we for the <code>acts_as_archive</code> and <code>searchlogic</code> gems. I don&#8217;t have the errors to hand right now, but they were show-stoppers. Quite a lot of the errors we encountered were because we were using older versions of gems, or that the gems had not been updated on their &#8220;canonical&#8221; repositories so we had to find forks. These were both this kind of error.</p>

<p><code>acts_as_archive</code> was easy enough to upgrade, we found <a href='http://github.com/xxx/acts_as_archive'>a fork by xxx</a> for it and pointed our Gemfile at that. We found out that the <em>gemspec</em> wasn&#8217;t quite right (it referenced a non-existant <code>rails</code> directory) and so we committed a patch to make it stop displaying a warning for it and xxx was kind enough to merge it.</p>

<p>Then there was Searchlogic. What a gigantic clusterfuck of code. I don&#8217;t blame him for writing such terrible code, it was written before ARel existed and ARel does effectively most of what Searchlogic does anyway. I&#8217;m sure <a href='http://github.com/binarylogic'>binarylogic</a> has the best intentions at heart, but his code is really fucking confusing for me. We also found a <a href='http://github.com/railsdog/searchlogic'>Rails 3 compatible fork of Searchlogic by railsdog</a> and it worked for most cases. We ended up chucking it out and writing our own scopes using ARel (which, if at all possible, has now made me <strong>more</strong> in love with Aaron Patterson), including a custom <a href='https://gist.github.com/663752'>module of our (Jason and myself) own called `WildcardSearch`</a>. This allows us to search for keywords in specific fields of the table we&#8217;re looking up in, and allows us to also do queries on associated records too. Check out the code, it&#8217;s great stuff.</p>

<p>In the application there was a <em>config/preinitializer.rb</em> which was being used for setting up Bundler, as well as defining constants or changing things such as the default date formatting in the application. For Rails 2.3.8, you need the <em>config/preinitializer.rb</em> to load Bundler, but because we upgraded to Rails 3 this part of the file was now redundant&#8230; but where would you put the constants / settings? We decided it would be best to move them into an initializer, which involved quite simply creating a new file at <em>config/initializers/default.rb</em> and moving the code across. Generally speaking, any code that sets up your application&#8217;s environment should now be placed in <em>config/initializers</em>, not <em>lib</em>.</p>

<p>Next up, in <em>config/environments/production.rb</em> we set the <code>config.active_support.deprecation</code> to <code>:notify</code> so that when the application was running in production mode (like when we were running <code>rails console production</code>) it would show us the deprecation warnings in the console rather than hiding them. We also set this same setting to <code>:stderr</code> in the <em>config/environments/test.rb</em> and <em>config/environments/development.rb</em> files. Also in these files there was reference to an old setting called <code>consider_all_requests_local</code>, which we removed reference to.</p>

<p>The first deprecation warning that came up when <code>rails console production</code> decided it wanted to start booting our application was that the syntax in our routes file was deprecated. This was because we were using the deprecated mapper, which in simple terms meaning that our routes went like this:</p>

<pre><code>ActionController::Routing::Routes.draw do |map|
  map.root :controller =&gt; &quot;welcome&quot;, :action =&gt; &quot;index&quot;</code></pre>

<p>When they should be something like this:</p>

<pre><code>Rails.application.routes.draw do
  root :to =&gt; &quot;welcome#index&quot;</code></pre>

<p>Ahh, much better! This is where we stuffed up, we should have run the <code>rake rails:upgrade:routes</code> command <em>before</em> we ran <code>rails new .</code> because the rails upgrade plugin only works on a Rails 2 application. We spent a couple of minutes going through this file fixing up all the lines in this file to use their new syntax. Whilst it&#8217;s handy to know how each of the methods map across between Rails 2 and 3, it&#8217;s also good to know that if you don&#8217;t know what a route <em>should</em> be in Rails 3 that you can reference the <a href='http://guides.rubyonrails.org/routing.html'>Routing Guide</a>. The current (as-of-writing) gem version for <em>declarative_authorization</em> is 0.5 and it uses this old, deprecated routing syntax too. Thankfully sttfn has updated his gem like all good gem authors <em>should</em>, and we were able to load the gem straight from GitHub with this line:</p>

<pre><code>gem &#39;declarative_authorization&#39;, :git =&gt; &quot;git://github.com/stffn/declarative_authorization&quot;</code></pre>

<p>The next warnings when running <code>rails console production</code> was that we were using <code>named_scope</code> when in Rails 3 the correct method is simply <code>scope</code>. We did a find-and-replace to fix these up, only to run <code>rails console</code> and to find out that <code>authlogic</code> this time was the one throwing the remaining warnings. I&#8217;d already done an upgrade at GetUp from Rails 2 to Rails 3 and because binarylogic is inattentive of his gems I went about doing an upgrade for it to make it work with Rails 3, resulting in <a href='http://github.com/radar/authlogic'>my fork of authlogic</a> which should have all the deprecation warnings fixed.</p>

<p>More ActiveRecord deprecations were next, with a couple of callbacks in our application defined like this:</p>

<pre><code>def after_update
  # do something
end</code></pre>

<p>Other callbacks like <code>before_create</code> and <code>after_create</code> existed too. Rather than defining the callback methods like this, the correct way in Rails 3 to define these is to define them as methods (private ones for bonus points) and then use the callback to call them, like this:</p>

<pre><code>after_update :do_something

def do_something
  something.do!
end</code></pre>

<p>It&#8217;s best practice to define the callbacks like this because you may have multiple callbacks you want to run after a record has been updated, or created or whatever.</p>

<p>It was after this that our <code>rails console production</code> booted with no errors. Great! The application has RSpec and test/unit tests, and I&#8217;m very partial to RSpec so we tried running it and it bombed too. We bumped the version number of <code>rspec-rails</code> up to 2.0.1 in the <em>Gemfile</em>, ran <code>bundle install</code> again and then tried running the tests. They failed because of this error:</p>

<pre><code>no such file to load -- spec</code></pre>

<p>We had to change the requires in <em>spec/spec_helper.rb</em> from this:</p>

<pre><code>require &#39;spec/autorun&#39;
require &#39;spec/rails&#39;
require &#39;spec&#39;</code></pre>

<p>To this:</p>

<pre><code>require &#39;rspec/autorun&#39;
require &#39;rspec/rails&#39;
require &#39;rspec&#39;</code></pre>

<p>Also in this file, the <code>Spec::Runner</code> constant doesn&#8217;t exist, and this is used for this line further down in the file:</p>

<pre><code>Spec::Runner.configure do |config|
   ...
end</code></pre>

<p>RSpec is now configured using the <code>RSpec</code> constant, so the above lines are now:</p>

<pre><code>RSpec.configure do |config|
  ...
end</code></pre>

<p>At this point RSpec was launching and we were informed of our next deprecation warning: the <code>cache_template_loading</code> setting for the application configuration (ours was in <em>config/environments/test.rb</em>) has been deprecated, and so we had to remove it. After this our specs were at least running (but not all passing), and so we decided we&#8217;d come back to them after we attempted to get the test/unit tests to pass. Just like <code>rails console</code> and the RSpec tests before them, they bombed too.</p>

<p>This time it was due to this error:</p>

<pre><code>no such file to load -- test_help</code></pre>

<p>To be honest, I don&#8217;t use test/unit to test Rails applications, I just hate it. I was pairing with Lucas on the application and he&#8217;d been brought up to only ever use RSpec and Cucumber, so he was just following my lead on this one. Then I made a bad mistake: <strong>I removed the test_help line</strong>.</p>
<small>We found out a few days later that this file is actually now at `rails/test_help`. This file is incredibly important for transactions in tests and it wasn't until Wednesday when we fixed this problem. Don't make the same mistake as us, it's important!</small>
<p>In quite a lot of our test/unit tests we had this line:</p>

<pre><code>include ActionController::Assertions::SelectorAssertions</code></pre>

<p>This module has now been moved into Action Dispatch and so the correct <code>include</code> is this:</p>

<pre><code>include ActionDispatch::Assertions::SelectorAssertions</code></pre>

<p>The rest of Monday was spent working on writing the <code>WildcardSearch</code> module and getting stuck on a little bug with it.</p>
<h3>Tuesday</h3><strong>Partner: Jason</strong>
<p>This was the first day that I got to pair with <a href='http://twitter.com/jasoncodes'>Jason Weathered (@jasoncodes)</a> and we carried on the good work that Lucas and I did the day before. Jason&#8217;s been doing Rails for about a year now but is scarily on or very near my level. Dude is amazing.</p>

<p>The first problem we fixed on Tuesday was that <code>rake spec</code> was running, but not returning anything. It turns out that it this is because we had <code>rspec-rails</code> in the <code>:test</code> group which means that its rake tasks were only being loaded in the <code>test</code> environment, where by running <code>rake spec</code> we need them to exist in the <code>:development</code> group. Moving this gem into a group block like this:</p>

<pre><code>group :development, :test do 
  gem &#39;rspec-rails&#39;, &#39;2.0.1&#39;
end</code></pre>

<p>This makes RSpec&#8217;s rake tasks available in the <code>development</code> environment so we were able to run <code>rake spec.</code> All of Tuesday was spent trying to get the RSpec tests to pass once again.</p>

<p>With the forked version of Searchlogic we were using, our <code>*_like_any</code> methods like the one used in this method:</p>

<pre><code>def text_contains(text)
  name_or_description_or_optional_originator_username_or_status_like_any
end</code></pre>

<p>Just weren&#8217;t working. The methods were apparently undefined. The intention of this method is to find an Event with a name or description containing keywords. Let&#8217;s assume that <code>text</code> in this context is &#8220;foo bar&#8221;, the query the <code>like_any</code> method uses here will look up an <code>Event</code> record which has a name containing either foo <em>OR</em> bar, or a description containing either foo <em>OR</em> bar, or a related user who&#8217;s username contains either foo <em>OR</em> bar. It&#8217;s a messy query, and this Searchlogic method generated it for us. I&#8217;m not going to post the mess here. We replaced this method with v1 of our <code>WildcardSearch</code> module, the end-result (on Thursday) looking like this:</p>

<pre><code>def text_contains(text)
  self.includes(:originator).wildcard_search(:name, :description, { :originator =&gt; :username })
end</code></pre>

<p>We use <code>includes</code> here and pass it an association name. ARel&#8217;s really smart and will know if we use the association name here what table to join. Even better than that, when we use a <code>where</code> later on in that same query, it will use a <code>LEFT OUTER JOIN</code> to join that table and run the query on the <code>events</code> and <code>users</code> tables. ARel is extremely capable of doing what Searchlogic did, it&#8217;s Rails 3 compatible and it&#8217;s supported by somebody who&#8217;s fairly active in the community: Aaron Patterson. It was about this moment where we decided to scrap all usage of Searchlogic in our application favour of ARel. After this replacement, quite a few of our failing specs were passing.</p>

<p>A large majority of this day was spent cherry-picking off failing specs. The first of these was that our tests making sure the validations were in place were checking that the error message contains a string:</p>

<pre><code>thing.errors[:user_id].should == &quot;has already been taken&quot;</code></pre>

<p>When in Rails 3, errors<span>:attribute</span> now returns an <code>Array</code>. The Rails 3 correct version of this is:</p>

<pre><code>thing.errors[:user_id].should == [&quot;has already been taken&quot;]</code></pre>

<p>Fixing this fixed up even more of our specs, but we still had work to go. During the running of our specs we encountered a deprecation warning with our mailer:</p>

<pre><code>Notifier.deliver_confirmation_instructions is deprecated, use Notifier.confirmation_instructions.deliver instead.</code></pre>

<p>We fixed this up nice and quickly and looked through the application for <code>deliver_</code> and fixed those deprecations up too. Personally I prefer to use the <code>deliver!</code> alias method as a &#8220;destructive&#8221; / &#8220;undoable&#8221; method.</p>

<p>The next issue we came across was to do with a little change between Rails 2 and 3 in regards to partial rendering. It had to do with a line like this:</p>

<pre><code>render :partial =&gt; &quot;some/partial&quot;, :collection =&gt; @things</code></pre>

<p>In Rails 2, when you pass the <code>:collection</code> option to <code>render</code> like this, each of the objects are passed to the partial as <code>object</code>. In Rails 3, this changes to be the name of the partial itself mainly because now you can do things like this:</p>

<pre><code>render @things</code></pre>

<p>Let&#8217;s assume for the time being that the <code>@things</code> variable is a collection of <code>Thing</code> objects. When you call <code>render @things</code> this will render, by default, the partial at <em>app/views/things/_things.html.erb</em>. The objects of the collection are then passed through as the local variable <code>thing</code>. Our problem was that we were using the Rails 2 line, and so Rails 3 was assuming that we wanted the variables still called after the partial. To give the variables the right name we use lines like this:</p>

<pre><code>render :partial =&gt; &quot;some/partial&quot;, :collection =&gt; @things, :as =&gt; :other_thing</code></pre>

<p>Now the objects will be available in the partial as <code>other_thing</code>. This fixed most of the view breakages, although we had another big one coming up.</p>

<p>That was the <code>nested_layouts</code> gem which is no longer compatible with Rails 3. To fix this, we used <a href='http://guides.rubyonrails.org/layouts_and_rendering.html#using-nested-layouts'>this section</a> from the bottom of the Layouts and Rendering guide for Rails 3. I think this is a much more elegant solution to the <code>nested_layouts</code> hackery.</p>

<p>After fixing <em>that</em> test, the next problem was that one of our files in <em>lib</em> was not being loaded. This is because in Rails 2 the files in <em>lib</em> are autoloaded, where in Rails 3 you must manually require them. Or at least you would if you didn&#8217;t have this option in <em>config/application.rb</em>:</p>

<pre><code>config.load_paths += %W( #{config.root}/lib )</code></pre>

<p>If you wanted to add more directories to be autoloaded just add them to this array. With this small change we fixed some more &#8220;broken&#8221; tests.</p>

<p>The next problem was that we were getting this error in some of our views:</p>

<pre><code>undefined local variable or method `form_remote_tag&#39;</code></pre>

<p>In Rails 2 the <code>form_remote_tag</code> and related methods have been moved out into a plugin called <code>prototype_legacy_helper</code>. We installed this plugin using this command:</p>

<pre><code>rails plugin:install git://github.com/rails/prototype_legacy_helper</code></pre>

<p>After installing this plugin our tests were <em>still</em> failing. We later found out that it was a bug with <code>prototype_legacy_helper</code> itself so I asked Jos Valim (the Rails core member) who maintains it. He replied &#8220;I don&#8217;t know&#8221;. Uh oh. So Jason and I fixed the bug and in doing so I gained commit rights to the project. Therefore I suppose I&#8217;m now the maintainer of it. If you want a bug fixed in it send in a patch and I&#8217;ll apply it.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s how we wrapped up Tuesday.</p>
<h3>Wednesday</h3><strong>Partner: Jason</strong>
<p>Jason and I were pairing on Wednesday too. By this point, we&#8217;d fixed the major issues with the application and were just going through the deprecation warnings in the application. A lot of the changes for this day were fixing deprecation warnings in the application, and so this day may seem like we didn&#8217;t do much, but we did quite a bit.</p>

<p>One of the major changes was that now any helper that outputs something in a view uses the <code>&lt;%=</code> ERB tag, rather than <code>&lt;%</code>. The latter&#8217;s going to be deprecated in Rails 3.1 so it&#8217;s best that we switch this over. Most of this happened on the <code>form_for</code>, but we had a couple of <code>content_tag</code>s that were doing it too.</p>

<p>We started off the day by realising that we didn&#8217;t need the <em>config/environments/cucumber.rb</em> file any more, Cucumber now runs within the &#8220;test&#8221; environment rather than its own special &#8220;cucumber&#8221; environment. This also means that we could remove the <code>cucumber</code> key from <em>config/database.yml</em> as that database setting is never used.</p>

<p>A couple of our functional tests had referenced a constant &#8211; <code>ActionController::TestUploadedFile</code> &#8211; which is now available in Rack instead as <code>Rack::Test::UploadedFile</code>. There was also some tests referring to fixtures which we converted over to using Factory Girl&#8217;s factories.</p>

<p>We also had a plugin which had its <em>tasks</em> folder in the root of the directory, where Rails 3 expects it to be in <em>lib/tasks</em>. It was a plugin of our own making so we moved this folder into its proper spot.</p>

<p>The application Sass extensively, so when we tried the application through <code>rails server</code>, it created new files at <em>public/stylesheets</em> for the parsed Sass stylesheets. This is incorrect, as the Hassle gem we had installed should have been putting them into a <em>tmp</em> folder and reading it from there because this application is deployed on Heroku. To fix this, we changed the <code>gem</code> specification of hassle in our <em>Gemfile</em> to this:</p>

<pre><code>gem &#39;hassle&#39;, &#39;0.0.1&#39;, :git =&gt; &#39;git://github.com/fphilipe/hassle.git&#39;</code></pre>

<p>Next, we created an initializer to load Hassle in as a middleware, called <em>config/initializers/hassle.rb</em>:</p>

<pre><code>Rails.configuration.middleware.use Hassle</code></pre>

<p>With fphilipe&#8217;s fork of <code>hassle</code>, we were able to get the stylesheets to go in the correct directory.</p>

<p>At the end of Wednesday, Jason and I came across a problem where a <code>flash[:notice]</code> was seemingly being lost and we spent the last half-an-hour trying to figure out why, to no avail.</p>
<h3>Thursday</h3><strong>Partner: Lucas</strong>
<p>On Thursday on the way in I talked to Lucas about Wednesday night&#8217;s problem and suggested it could be a double redirect as I had seen it happen before on an application. Turns out that was the problem, and we used <code>flash.keep</code> to keep the flash for the next request. With this final little change, all the test/unit tests, functionals and RSpec tests were passing. Time to get the Cucumber features to pass.</p>

<p>One of the little minor-changes-that-breaks-everything was that in Rails 2 the submit button for a form, if not given an argument, defaulted to &#8220;Save changes&#8221;. In Rails 3, this now defaults to either &#8220;Create <span>Object</span>&#8221; where <span>Object</span> is the class name of the form&#8217;s object, or &#8220;Update <span>Object</span>&#8221;. The view inspects the model object it&#8217;s given to determine what the button should display! I think this is much better, but it just about broke The Everything. We went through the features and did a manual find-and-replace for all these occurrences and fixed them up.</p>

<p>Next, we had a helper which was outputting HTML as a string. This is problematic because in Rails 3, all HTML-as-a-string is marked as unsafe, and is escaped. To fix this we used <code>html_safe</code> on the return value of this helper. There was also another helper in this file which we fixed up a little later on too.</p>

<p>The next deprecation warning we came across wasn&#8217;t to do with Rails, but Capybara. It was this:</p>

<pre><code>DEPRECATED: #click is deprecated, please use #click_link_or_button instead</code></pre>

<p>We found the offending step and changed it to use this new method.</p>

<p>It was at about this point that we decided to scrap Searchlogic. On our <code>Person</code> model we had a boolean field called <code>active</code> which Searchlogic should have been defining a scope much like this for:</p>

<pre><code>scope :active, where(:active =&gt; true)</code></pre>

<p>Sadly, this wasn&#8217;t working. My suspicion was that it was defining it something like this:</p>

<pre><code>scope :active, where(:active =&gt; &#39;t&#39;)</code></pre>

<p>or</p>

<pre><code>scope :active, where(:active =&gt; &#39;true&#39;)</code></pre>

<p>As I stated before, Searchlogic is a clusterfuck of a codebase and so I didn&#8217;t really want go hunting in there. I also said before that ARel does exactly what Searchlogic did, so we scrapped Searchlogic. A quick run of the RSpec tests picked up any occurrences where we removed Something Important and we re-implemented the scopes with ARel. Probably took us all of 10 minutes.</p>

<p>In some custom code we had this:</p>

<pre><code>some_association.scoped(:include =&gt; :children)</code></pre>

<p>It took me a little while before I realised that you can just use ARel for this too:</p>

<pre><code>some_association.includes(:children)</code></pre>

<p>It was just one of those way-too-obvious fixes that you overlook initially and then gape in awe when you write it.</p>
<h3>Friday</h3><strong>Partner: Jason</strong>
<p>The final day!</p>

<p>We had some features that used the <code>WildcardSearch</code> module that were failing, even though we were <em>positive</em> it was correct. Turns out it wasn&#8217;t case-insensitive! Also turns out that Rails 3.0.1 (well, actually the version of ARel that <em>comes with</em> Rails 3.0.1), doesn&#8217;t support case-insensitive matching with the <em>matches</em> method. Thankfully there&#8217;s a smart-cookie out there who&#8217;s written <a href='https://rails.lighthouseapp.com/projects/8994/tickets/3174-add-support-for-postgresql-citext-column-type'>a beautiful patch</a> for it, <strong>but it only works with PostgreSQL</strong>. That&#8217;s fine, we&#8217;re smart so we use PostgreSQL. We used the patch&#8217;s code in an initializer and it worked flawlessly.</p>

<p>During the running of our tests, we used <code>Then show me the page</code> <strong>a lot</strong>. This resulted in lots of <em>capybara-[timestamp]</em> files in the root directory. To fix this little problem, we put this code in our <em>features/support/app.rb</em> file:</p>

<pre><code>Capybara.save_and_open_page_path = Rails.root + &#39;tmp&#39;</code></pre>

<p>All fixed!</p>

<p>One of our actions returned two formats: a <code>html</code> version and a <code>pdf</code> format. In the <code>pdf</code> <code>respond_to</code> block the code looked like this:</p>

<pre><code>@template.template_format = :html
kit = PDFKit.new(render_to_string)</code></pre>

<p>It turns out that <code>@template</code> is no longer an accessible-from-the-controller variable. Who&#8217;d have thunk it? To work around this problem, we had to use the (undocumented! grr) <code>:action</code> option for <code>render_to_string</code>, changing the final line to this:</p>

<pre><code>kit = PDFKit.new(render_to_string(:action =&gt; &#39;print.html.haml&#39;))</code></pre>

<p>We simply wanted the <code>html</code> version of this template, where as this code was trying to render the <code>print.pdf.erb</code> template which simply didn&#8217;t exist.</p>

<p>The next issue was that we were using <code>find_or_create_by*</code> in a step like this:</p>

<pre><code>role = @project.roles.find_or_create_by_name(role_name, :category =&gt; category)</code></pre>

<p>This syntax isn&#8217;t supported in Rails 3 (it thinks that <code>:category</code> is a key like <code>:joins</code> or <code>:includes</code>) and so we had to change it to the way-more-verbose this:</p>

<pre><code>role = @project.roles.find_by_name(role_name) || @project.roles.create!(:name =&gt; role_name, :category =&gt; category)</code></pre>

<p>That was the final Rails 3-caused issue that we came across on Friday, and by 4pm we had all the Cucumber features, RSpec specs, and test/unit tests all passing. Everything worked.</p>
<h3>So now what?</h3>
<p>Well, Ennova&#8217;s not going to deploy this application directly to production just yet. I&#8217;d say they should give it a week on staging so that one of the business guys can go through the application and make sure it&#8217;s working as intended. The application isn&#8217;t <em>completely</em> covered in tests, so there&#8217;s bound to be something we missed out. For the most part though, it&#8217;s a fully-functional Rails 3 application working nearly-exactly like it did in Rails 2.</p>

<p>A lot of the upgrading work was done on Monday and Tuesday, with quite a large majority of the remaining time spent just fixing deprecation warnings in our application or making the tests better. All in all, I think it went very well.</p>

<p>I hope this helps somebody out there get up the nerve to upgrade their application to Rails 3. It&#8217;s stable, it&#8217;s proven to work (Gemcutter, for instance, runs Rails 3) and it&#8217;s awesome. Also, with all <a href='http://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/3_0_release_notes.html'>the new features in Rails 3</a>, how can you resist?</p>}]]></content>

   <title>Gone from GetUp</title>
   <link href="http://ryanbigg.com/2010/10/gone-from-getup"/>
   <updated>2010-10-30T00:00:00+10:00</updated>
   <id>http://ryanbigg.com/2010/10/gone-from-getup</id>
   <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday was my last day at GetUp. I&#8217;m moving on to bigger and better things now.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;ve been <a href='http://twitter.com/ryanbigg'>following me on Twitter</a> you would have been able to work out by the hints that I&#8217;ve been dropping all week that this was the case. If you didn&#8217;t work it out from the hints then <a href='http://twitter.com/#!/ryanbigg/status/29062245881'>one of last night's messages</a> should have spelled it out clearly enough.</p>

<p>During my time there, I was training up the ex-PHP developers in the ways of Ruby on Rails whilst developing the new version of GetUp&#8217;s website. This is definitely the kind of work that I want to do for as long as I&#8217;m able, it&#8217;s been a blast.</p>

<p>There are many reasons why I&#8217;m leaving the organisation and some of them cannot be made public. What can be made public is that last Thursday changed everything.</p>

<p>I received news early that morning that a very good UK friend of mine, (Angus / Fares Yusuf) Donaldson, had passed away 6 days prior. We had met online a couple of years back, hanging out in #rubyonrails, #offrails and more recently #railsbridge together. It was until March this year when I was on my way to Scotland that we met in person, staying in Heathrow Airport for 7 hours during an epic layover between flights. I kept telling Angus that my flight was at 2:30pm and he kept saying it was fine. By the time Angus brought me to the correct terminal, the flight had already gone through final boarding and I hadn&#8217;t even checked in yet! Angus thought that the <em>check-in</em> time was the one I was saying, NOT the flight departure time. Whilst I was mildly panicking, he sweet-talked an airhostess and got me on the next available flight. I&#8217;ll miss him quite a lot. It made me feel mortal. If the indestructible Angus could die, then I could too.</p>

<p>Later on that morning the other friend I caught up with in the UK, Sam Elliott, sent me a DM about a job that I may be interested in. I looked into it and contacted the people offering it, but then had to leave for work. Was still in a shocked/dazed state when I arrived, I don&#8217;t remember much. At about 10am I had a chat to the company but I wasn&#8217;t able to offer my help because I wasn&#8217;t sure if my contract was going to end the following week or not.</p>

<p>This was one of the things about GetUp and my contract. I never received a paper copy until about 6 months in. During the whole time I was there, my contract was extended by about a month per time, going from end of May to end of June, to end of July, to end of October. These discussions happened usually less than 1 week before the contract expired. Obviously there was still work to do, but I had no hint if the contract was going to still be extended or not. I would have preferred greater notice.</p>

<p>On Thursday night I got some bad news: they were going to be letting two of my team go, James and Charles. I read it as they were &#8220;thinking&#8221; of doing it, but the following Monday found out it was a definite. On Monday afternoon, each of the Online team had one-on-ones with Daryl and Simon with Charles and then James going first. I asked James what they asked him and he showed me a letter with &#8220;Redundancy&#8221; as the header. To be perfectly honest, I was furious at this stage. They were letting the two full-time people on the team who were getting decent at Rails go. I calmed down, sat through my one-on-one without leaping the desk and smashing Simon&#8217;s stupid face into a bloody pulp, went home, and cried.</p>

<p>I talked with a lot of people that night. That was the theme over the next few days as well, just pure talking. Voice chats, text messages, Skype chats&#8230; it was just so much talking. The company I spoke to on Thursday asked me again on Tuesday morning if I&#8217;d still be interested and I basically said &#8220;yes, I&#8217;m very much interested and leaning that way now, but I have to talk to my boss&#8221;. So on Tuesday morning I spoke with Daryl who sympathised with my anger, but wished that I could stay on 6 more weeks. I said that I would have to speak with the other company again.</p>

<p>Wednesday morning, that&#8217;s what happened. They said they needed somebody right away and if they couldn&#8217;t get me, then they&#8217;d have to move on. If I didn&#8217;t leave GetUp, I could have potentially missed out on this fabulous opportunity. I told Daryl the bad news Wednesday morning and he said he was disappointed but agreed that I had to do what was best for me. At the end of the week, I would be leaving GetUp and moving on.</p>

<p>The other company was really happy when I told them late Wednesday morning, and so was I. It&#8217;s something that I&#8217;ve wanted to do for quite a long time and I really think it&#8217;ll benefit the community in a great way. Sorry for being so cryptic about the details, just there&#8217;s very little that I&#8217;m able to share right now.</p>

<p>Thursday and Friday was handover with Alex (contractor) and Francois (full-timer). I wish them the best of luck in developing and delivering v3. On Friday at the team meeting I got given a great well wishes card from the team as well as an awesome satchel bag for my laptop that doesn&#8217;t look as dodgy as a backpack.</p>

<p>On Sunday, my contract expires. After that, I&#8217;m going to be spending two weeks in Brisbane, one of them working for a company up there doing a Rails 3 upgrade work and some pairing with their team and then the following week I begin my contract at this new job. It&#8217;s a remote contract so I&#8217;ll probably just be desk-hopping around the place doing the work. I&#8217;d like to not stay in the house the whole time. The weekend after that is Railscamp, which I&#8217;m really looking forward to.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m still going to be writing Rails 3 in Action during this new contract. We&#8217;re hoping to have a new release out Real Soon Now(tm), as soon as I get some time to speak with Yehuda about the latest major review comments. It should contain chapters 1-10 with 11 coming Real Soon After(tm).</p>

<p>The future&#8217;s looking good. See you there.</p>}]]></content>

   <title>Writing isn't all rainbows</title>
   <link href="http://ryanbigg.com/2010/10/writing-isnt-all-rainbows"/>
   <updated>2010-10-19T00:00:00+10:00</updated>
   <id>http://ryanbigg.com/2010/10/writing-isnt-all-rainbows</id>
   <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>There, I said it and I&#8217;ll say it again.</p>

<p>Writing isn&#8217;t all rainbows.</p>

<p>What do I mean by this? Put simply: it&#8217;s not an enjoyable process all of the time. It has its moments, both good and bad. Right now you may be able to tell I&#8217;m having a bad one. I should be writing Rails 3 in Action, but instead I&#8217;m writing this post.</p>

<p>As a famous author once said: &#8220;Writing is like taking a shit. Don&#8217;t if you don&#8217;t <strong>have</strong> to.&#8221;. So I&#8217;m not writing tonight. I am simply not in the mood for it, and to be perfectly honest I am feeling a lot burned out tonight. I am human too.</p>

<p>Writing Rails 3 in Action is difficult. I have to stay on top of the gem changes (such as rspec and rails, which should now be stable) and know what is the &#8220;accepted best practice&#8221; of how to do something. I then have to explain that in exceptional detail so that people get it on their first read and know what I&#8217;m thinking at this point. If a reader gets lost, then I have failed.</p>

<p>I do most of my writing on the weekends, since I am working full time at GetUp. Chapter 8 took me almost a month to complete because it was a very complex chapter that had a lot going on all at once. I eventually re-wrote it and people have been saying it&#8217;s much better. Relief. Chapter 10 took me a little over a week. Chapter 11 should be completed this weekend (its third weekend).</p>

<p>If you&#8217;re thinking of writing a book ask yourself one question: What makes yours unique? I&#8217;m trying to make Rails 3 in Action unique by using Cucumber, RSpec, Rails and all the other gems we use to build a full-featured application throughout the entire book. I hope this is unique enough for the readers.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m not writing this for the money. Being honest, the advances I&#8217;ve been receiving wouldn&#8217;t even fund my rent for the time it took to write the part I&#8217;m being paid for, let alone all the other fun things you have to pay for in life. There is no way I can live on just the money from the book advances, so I work. Working what is basically super-full-time takes its toll on a person after a while, and I get a little down.</p>

<p>However, when you work at a job where there&#8217;s interesting challenges to solve and good people to work with, then that isn&#8217;t as much of a drag as some would think. GetUp&#8217;s like that, and I&#8217;m thankful for that. I can go home at the end of the day feeling &#8220;accomplished&#8221; and thinking &#8220;what can I accomplish on the book tonight?&#8221;. Those kinds of nights I&#8217;ll bash out a section or two. Tonight is not one of those nights, for reasons I won&#8217;t go into right now.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m not writing the book for the money. I&#8217;m not writing it for the fame (got enough, thanks). I&#8217;m writing it because when a person tweets about it or posts to the forum and uses phrases like &#8220;awesome!&#8221; and &#8220;thanks for this, I really love what you&#8217;ve done!&#8221;&#8230;</p>

<p>That&#8217;s the &#8220;rainbows&#8221; I live for. That&#8217;s what I write for.</p>

<p>Thanks for your support so far. It makes nights like this all that more tolerable.</p>}]]></content>

   <title>Lighthouse has problems, but they're fixing them</title>
   <link href="http://ryanbigg.com/2010/10/lighthouse-has-problems-but-theyre-fixing-them"/>
   <updated>2010-10-11T00:00:00+10:00</updated>
   <id>http://ryanbigg.com/2010/10/lighthouse-has-problems-but-theyre-fixing-them</id>
   <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>After I wrote my <a href='http://ryanbigg.com/2010/10/lighthouse-has-problems/'>Lighthouse has problems</a> post last week, I was contacted by ENTP who asked to speak to me regarding some clarifications, and now I&#8217;ve finally gotten around to posting them.</p>

<p>Firstly: ENTP is working on a major upgrade of Lighthouse. They <a href='http://help.lighthouseapp.com/discussions/problems/1791-spammers-taking-over'>plan on fixing the spam issue </a>and will have trusted and untrusted user accounts, where trusted users can change the title and tags of a ticket. They will also implement rate limiting which will be a way to detect the spammers current tactics on LH. This fixes points #2 and #4 of my post.</p>

<p>Secondly: there&#8217;s now less tickets for Rails itself with the <a href='https://rails.lighthouseapp.com/projects/8994-ruby-on-rails/tickets/bins/5837'>"Open Tickets"</a> currently hovering around 753. This is because of the wonderful team of Lighthouse volunteers including David Trasbo, Rohit Arondekar who have been marking old tickets as stale and replying to those which need patches. If you have a ticket which you&#8217;d like some eyes on, assign it to one of us and we&#8217;ll take a peek.</p>

<p>Thirdly: I wrote <a href='http://gist.github.com/617963'>a Mechanize script</a> to revert / delete the spam comments, which will stave off the problem until ENTP can get around to fixing their system. Myself and a couple of other volunteers run this whenever spammers are detected. Seems to do the trick quite nicely, but the code is ugly as all hell.</p>

<p>I have to play the devil&#8217;s advocate here: Lighthouse doesn&#8217;t suck, entirely. It&#8217;s a bit rough around the edges but it&#8217;s no Trac. Remember Trac? Good times were had, and spam was a problem back then. It&#8217;s a tricky problem to solve and I hope that the Lighthouse guys can actually do some serious work on it, maybe even implement a <em>proper</em> spam filter, such as Akismet, but nothing is perfect.</p>

<p>Lighthouse is serving us perfectly fine right now, it&#8217;s just a little cluttered. We&#8217;re working on that, and we&#8217;d like your help. If you could spend some of your time this week going through the <a href='https://rails.lighthouseapp.com/projects/8994-ruby-on-rails/tickets/bins/5837'>"Open Tickets"</a> and assigning old ones to one of either Rohit, David or myself, we&#8217;ll get right round to closing them up.</p>

<p>I&#8217;d like to see it below 700 by the end of next weekend.</p>}]]></content>

   <link href="http://ryanbigg.com/2010/10/lighthouse-has-problems"/>
   <updated>2010-10-06T00:00:00+10:00</updated>
   <id>http://ryanbigg.com/2010/10/lighthouse-has-problems</id>
   <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Once again, the Rails lighthouse is chockas. 944 open tickets as of this post.</p>

<p>That is disgraceful. I wrote how I felt back in April, and now I am just sad, not angry.</p>

<p>Nobody is willing to dedicate the time required to go through and play gatekeeper between these tickets and the core team, and so there is only a dribble of tickets actually being looked at / dealt with. Sure, we can have bugmashes every &#8220;x&#8221; &#8220;y&#8221;, but they only do so much. We need a continued effort to bring this number down and keep it down, but it&#8217;s not for the financial benefit of everyone, so nobody&#8217;s going to do it.</p>

<p>Besides that, Lighthouse has some quite serious issues itself. The sheer fact that I have to use an ordered list to outline the problems shows the extreme side of this situation.</p>
<ol>
  <li>There's no way for a project "admin" to completely delete / ban a user. For instance if I want to delete a <a href='https://rails.lighthouseapp.com/users/118614'>spamming fucktard</a> like this guy, I can't.</li>
  <li>There is no spam protection. If a user posts two comments within the space of a minute they should be prompted with a captcha. This will stop the bot spam, at least. Manual spam can be dealt with by fixing point #1.</li>
  <li>If I don't want to delete a user, but I want to delete <strong>some</strong> of their comments, I can't do that either.</li>
  <li>Normal users can change the title of a ticket <strong>they don't even own</strong>. See: "Diaspora Syndrome"</li>
  <li>When you delete the last comment of a ticket that has changed the title of that ticket, it doesn't revert the ticket's title</li>
  <li>There are currently 1,584 tags for Rails lighthouse alone. The problem here is that <strong>anybody</strong> can add a tag to a ticket. <strong>Most of the tags only have one ticket assigned to them.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>But ENTP won&#8217;t fix these issues. They have much more exciting products to work on now. It&#8217;s a product that was developed years ago and they have a tiny team working on maintaining it. This is sad, too.</p>

<p>The maintenance of the Rails lighthouse is non-existant. The maintenance of Lighthouse in general is almost non-existant. This makes me sad. These problems seem almost unfixable to me as a single person. But together, as a community, we can work on fixing the Rails Lighthouse.</p>

<p>Please, please, please: spend some time each week looking at the tickets on the Lighthouse. Do these things:</p>
<ol>
<li>You can be extremely helpful just by assigning tickets that need to be closed, resolved, wontfix'd or marked as duplicate to me or anybody else on the "Assigned to" list.</li>
<li> If you want to be extremely extremely helpful, verify that patches apply correctly and if you think that specific patch should be applied to Rails and you've tested it, give that ticket a +1. Once the ticket has 3 +1s, assign it to somebody on the "Assigned to" list who will then mark it as verified. This is the final step before it gets tested + merged by Core.</li>
<li> If it doesn't apply, just put a comment there explaining what broke and hopefully the OP will fix it.</li>
<li> If you think that the patch <strong>should not</strong> be applied to Rails, give the ticket a comment with "-1" at the start, and a reason for the "downvote". When a ticket receives 3 -1s, it will be marked as "wontfix".</li>
</ol>
<p>A little help here?</p>}]]></content>

   <title>Gem Development Guide</title>

   <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>From <a href='http://ryanbigg.com/2010/09/advanced-rails-documentation/'>my request yesterday</a> asking people what Rails documentation would be valuable, a large group of respondents said they&#8217;d like to see a guide on how to develop a gem. As I figured this would only take me two days to write and would be a good way to promote <a href='http://manning.com/katz'>a certain book</a>, I&#8217;ve begun writing one which I should have finished by tonight with only generators and releasing to cover.</p>

<p>You <a href='http://github.com/radar/guides/blob/master/gem-development.md'>can see it here</a>.</p>

<p>This is the kind of guide I was talking about in yesterday&#8217;s post. They don&#8217;t have to be short and they don&#8217;t have to be long, they just have to be <em>informative</em>. Is this what people would like to see more of? Are the topics I put forward yesterday worthwhile covering or is there something more interesting to the Greater Audience?</p>}]]></content>

   <title>Advanced Rails Documentation</title>
   <link href="http://ryanbigg.com/2010/09/advanced-rails-documentation"/>
   <updated>2010-09-30T00:00:00+10:00</updated>
   <id>http://ryanbigg.com/2010/09/advanced-rails-documentation</id>
   <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Recently I&#8217;ve been talking to a lot of people about Rails. It&#8217;s what I do. Lots of these people I talked to were in San Francisco when I was. Some others were in Jacksonville Beach. A common thread of conversation was that to truly know the Rails internals you have to read the source and interpret it for yourself what it means. If only there were guides out there for the more advanced concepts in Rails.</p>

<p>There was discussions as recently as March this year about starting up a Rails Internals documentation group, much in the same vein that docrails has people who write the <a href='http://guides.rubyonrails.org'>Rails Guides</a>. These guides are top-notch and are a great boon to the resources of people who are just getting started with Rails, but there&#8217;s nothing comparable for those who are more advanced.</p>

<p>This is where the Rails Internals documentation comes in. It&#8217;s clear to me from the conversations I&#8217;ve had with people about Rails over the past couple of months that there&#8217;s a <strong>real need</strong> for some seriously good advanced documentation. There&#8217;s also the sidebar on <a href='http://yehudakatz.com'>Yehuda Katz's</a> blog for <a href='http://skribit.com'>Skribit</a>, where people can vote up posts they want Yehuda to write about. Yehuda&#8217;s too busy blowing our minds with other things (i.e. <a href='http://github.com/carlhuda/bundler'>Bundler</a> and now <a href='http://sproutcore.com'>SproutCore</a>) to write about them.</p>

<p>The highest request on that list is &#8220;migrating from rails 2.3.* to 3.0&#8221;, which is neatly covered by <a href='http://www.railsupgradehandbook.com/'>Jeremy McAnally's Rails 3 Upgrade Handbook</a>.</p>

<p>The second highest request on that list is &#8220;The lifecycle of a request through the rails stack&#8221;. This is an <strong>epic</strong> in itself. There&#8217;s an amazing amount of work that goes into rendering even a simple view through a controller, and that&#8217;s just the basic part of it. Your routes could route out to a Sinatra application, your model could actually be an ActiveResource model or a NoSQL model and you could be returning JSON data rather than an actual template.</p>
<h3>Fucking Rails man, how does it work?</h3>
<p>So I&#8217;ve been thinking for quite a while that it&#8217;d be nice to work on Rails documentation <strong>full time</strong>. Back in January when I was between jobs I begun writing the <a href='http://guides.rubyonrails.org/initialization.html'>Rails 3 Initialization Process</a> guide. I stopped writing it because I got a (kinda) paying gig writing <a href='http://manning.com/katz'>Rails 3 in Action</a>. I loved digging into the guts of Rails and explaining how they work. I got a great response from my initial postings of that guide and I&#8217;d like to complete it as the first in the Rails Internals Guides series, with the remainder beginning with:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Action Dispatch, receiving + serving requests</li>
  <li>Action Pack, finding controllers and response rendering</li>
  <li>Active Model, the different modules and how you can create your own ORM-like system</li>
  <li>Active Record, ARel &amp; things such as associations and dynamic finders</li>
</ul>
<p>Besides the &#8220;big picture&#8221;, I have no solid idea of precisely what would go in these guides, or even if they&#8217;re interesting to people outside the world of my own head.</p>

<p>Would I even be able to find a company to pay me to do this full-time? The biggest question is how it would benefit them. Wouldn&#8217;t it save time having some go-to place for Rails internals documentation so you don&#8217;t have to spend all that time trudging through it? I think so.</p>

<p>The second question: Is there a large enough audience interested in documentation in a similar vein to the <a href='http://guides.rubyonrails.org/initialization.html'>Initialization Guide</a>? Is that the &#8220;correct&#8221;/sensible way to do that? Is it useful?</p>
<strong>As a Rails programmer, what guides would you like to see written about Rails? It could just be about the ecosystem, not neccesarily the framework's code itself. Let me know in the comments.</strong>}]]></content>

   <title>You suck.</title>
   <link href="http://ryanbigg.com/2010/09/you-suck"/>
   <updated>2010-09-24T00:00:00+10:00</updated>
   <id>http://ryanbigg.com/2010/09/you-suck</id>
   <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The tense of the phrase &#8220;You suck&#8221; may not be the present. It may be the past. It may even be the future.</p>

<p>But face it: You suck. Right now.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m facing it too. I see people doing amazing things. Things like Facebook and LinkedIn know that, through some kind of complex association somebody who I&#8217;ve said as much as &#8220;hey&#8221; to could potentially be my friend. I don&#8217;t know how to do this, therefore I suck.</p>

<p>But let&#8217;s get back to you. At one point in the past, you decided you wanted to learn a language. Let&#8217;s, for the sake of the argument, say that this language is Ruby. You wrote a blogging application in Ruby on Rails and you thought you were top shit.</p>

<p>Then somebody else took a look at your code and their first reaction was to commit Seppuku.</p>

<p>Ok, maybe not that severe. But they didn&#8217;t have kind words.</p>

<p>A programming community is one of the harshest (non-weather-based) environments on the planet when you&#8217;re getting started. Just about everybody knows more than you do. They&#8217;ve been doing it for what seems like millennia and they&#8217;ve got the answer to every question you throw at them. If they&#8217;re patient, they&#8217;ll help you get going and perhaps give you pointers from time to time.</p>

<p>You&#8217;re still going to suck. You&#8217;ll gradually pick up things as you progress. Perseverance pays off in the end, but it&#8217;s a long way to travel. People will condemn and criticise you, your code and your coding practices. Others will be gentler. Stick with it.</p>

<p>So let&#8217;s say you&#8217;re a little peeved at the massive goliath that is Facebook and you want to create your own social networking application, but you&#8217;re going to make it distributed. Through some kind of magical process, you manage to acquire $200,000+ in funding to develop this from people just like you who don&#8217;t like Facebook and want an alternative.</p>

<p>Then, with this money, you develop it. You give it a cool name and the Internet Hype Machine does its thing. They expect it to be perfect, flawless in every way, shape and form. They expect you to be professional because they threw money at you. Little did they know that you don&#8217;t have all that much experience in developing. Your idea is solid, and you&#8217;ll learn what you need to as you go along.</p>

<p>Eventually you release a &#8220;Developer Preview&#8221; and that&#8217;s when things start looking stormy. People use words like &#8220;cesspool&#8221; to describe the quality of your code. Haters gonna hate.</p>

<p>Of course, by this point, you understand that I&#8217;m talking about Diaspora. There is <strong>so much hate</strong> on the intertubes about Diaspora right now. These four guys are not big players in the Ruby community. Their GitHub profiles have only a few projects on them. They are newbies to this wonderful world of Ruby and we, as stalwarts, need to play nice with the new kids on the block.</p>

<p>So how about this: instead of putting so much energy into hating Diaspora, how about you volunteer to help out? Oh, you don&#8217;t have time for that? Then shut the fuck up, armchair critic. These guys are working hard on their project, much like you are on yours.</p>

<p>At least, you would be if you weren&#8217;t hating on the new kids.</p>}]]></content>

   <title>Need Newbies</title>
   <link href="http://ryanbigg.com/2010/09/need-noobs"/>
   <updated>2010-09-23T00:00:00+10:00</updated>
   <id>http://ryanbigg.com/2010/09/need-noobs</id>
   <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m not sure if I&#8217;ve mentioned this before but I&#8217;m writing <a href='http://manning.com/katz'>Rails 3 in Action</a> and what I haven&#8217;t mentioned before is that I need newbies.</p>

<p>Newbies are the lifeblood of the Ruby community and without them we wouldn&#8217;t have a solid foundation. A community without a healthy supply of newbies is a community <strong>that is dying</strong>.</p>

<p>Have you hugged your neighbourhood noob today?</p>

<p>The reason I need newbies is because I&#8217;ve got all these awesome reviewers, but most of them are <strong>experienced</strong> Rails developers who are probably assuming the same things I am when reading the book. Somethings to us <strong>just make sense</strong>. Newbies don&#8217;t have this ability yet, so I need a couple of people who are interested about learning Ruby on Rails to buy my book and give it a nice hard read. I need the newbies to be critical of everything they read. I need them to point out where a wall-o&#8217;-text would be better described in picture form and maybe even a quick sketch if they&#8217;re artistically inclined.</p>

<p>I am really appreciative of the current mob I have reviewing the book (and I&#8217;m not cheating on you!), I just need more newbies.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m going to need about 3 more people. These three newbies need to have enough spare time to be able to read the chapters as I&#8217;m progressing along with them and provide feedback. Question everything. Does it only make 99% sense? Question it.</p>

<p>In return, I&#8217;m told I give good, manly handshakes. I may give you one too. Alternatively if you prefer the whole monetary system, I will pay you the cost of the PDF / book and then maybe <strong>some more</strong>.</p>

<p>Who&#8217;s up for this? <strong>If you want to help, buy a copy of <a href='http://manning.com/katz'>Rails 3 in Action</a>, have a read and post any issues you encounter on the forums! Thanks!</strong></p>}]]></content>

   <updated>2010-09-17T00:00:00+10:00</updated>
   <id>http://ryanbigg.com/2010/09/the-fake-update</id>
   <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Here&#8217;s a fake update I emailed to my mum earlier today:</p>

<p>Last couple of days have been great :)</p>

<p>Caught up with some strangers who I met online, they lured me into a non-descript white van and blindfolded me and we are somewhere warm underground. The candy was delicious and they say they have more.</p>

<p>But first I have to go and run some &#8220;errands&#8221; for them around San Francisco which they say involves something called &#8220;weed&#8221; (I recommended they go down to the hardware store and get some spray, works well. They laughed.) and some other thing about &#8220;popping caps&#8221; into peoples asses. I&#8217;m no proctologist but they said they would give me training and the tools to do it. Not looking forward to that part but apparently that&#8217;s business.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s this one guy here who people are telling me he&#8217;s &#8220;the man&#8221; (at first I thought they were saying he is &#8220;a man&#8221; and I was all &#8220;duh, have you SEEN his Adams apple?&#8221; and they clarified that they meant he was a &#8220;pig&#8221;. Again I was all &#8220;duh, have you seen him eat?&#8221; and they just rolled their eyes and walked away) I am not sure why he is the man, I was just told never to say it to his face.</p>

<p>Anyway, gotta roll out now. Love you heaps and will send back some presents for you when I get some time off.</p>

<p>(and if it isn&#8217;t obvious yet, this is a big joke and shouldn&#8217;t believed by anyone to be real. I&#8217;ll send you a real update later on :)</p>}]]></content>

   <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Tomorrow is the first day of the two day GoGaRuCo conference here (gasp!) in San Francisco. This is mostly for my family / friends interested in what I&#8217;ve been doing in SF. Just a brain dump of what&#8217;s made an impact so far. It contains boring stuff.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s some photos <a href='http://www.flickr.com/photos/radarlistener/sets/72157624970572352/'>[1]</a> <a href='http://www.flickr.com/photos/radarlistener/sets/72157624973230930/'>[2]</a> I&#8217;ve been taking whilst I&#8217;ve been in San Francisco. So far it&#8217;s been a really good town and I could definitely get used to living in a place like this (without the fog though).</p>

<p>In general: everyone is nice. The people who are driving will stop (at stop signs) and wait for you to cross, not run them just as you&#8217;re crossing. Still getting used to looking over my left shoulder rather than my right for cars that are turning into where I&#8217;m crossing though. I&#8217;ll figure that one out by Sunday next week.</p>

<p>I arrived on Monday and I&#8217;m living with two people called Cecilia and Spencer who are really nice and have offered me a comfy couch to sleep on for a reasonable price per night and I&#8217;m content with that. The major problem is that it&#8217;s at the top of this massive hill which I must climb every time I come home, be it sober or not sober. That&#8217;d be &#8220;Monte Vista Avenue&#8221; in the photo sets. I had dinner with a Perth guy who was visiting called Matt at a restaurant called Roxanne on Powell in town. The restaurant people here are almost over nice, but again something I could get used to. Went home at about 9pm and slept like a log.</p>

<p>On Tuesday I caught up with Santiago Pastorino, one of the newest Ruby on Rails core members. He&#8217;s from Uruguay and professes not to know much English but we can have a conversation just fine. He brought a friend called Gilberto and we hung out for lunch. Later on, I went home to grab my laptop and then back into town to attend the Heroku/PostgreSQL talk which I enjoyed. Met up with somebody who recognised me from my Twitter avatar, Josh Kalderimis, a NZ guy. He thanked me for my efforts in the Ruby &amp; Rails communities and we chat for a while about Ruby / job things. There was also two other guys called Nick and Ken. Ken was about to launch a beta version of his startup and expressed interest in hiring someone with Ruby talent and I got his card. Also met Terence Lee who I know through using Heroku who is an absolute god when it comes to answering support tickets. Went out drinking at a bar that had a multi-page Scotch menu called Nihon and walked out without paying. Remembered 5 minutes later and turned around and paid for my drink + 20% tip for being an idiot. Call it a Stupid Tax. Trained it home and tackled the hill fine, again sleeping like a log.</p>

<p>On Wednesday, I was going to go to Fisherman&#8217;s Wharf but thought better of it when Cecilia said she hadn&#8217;t been in a while and wanted to go. I had also planned on meeting a friend that day near Palo Alto (south of the city, by Caltrain) but didn&#8217;t know if it was for lunch or dinner. I loitered around in town by hanging out in the Apple store and buying a traveller&#8217;s kit so I could finally charge my phone and then a universal adapter for my laptop from Walgreens so I could also charge that. I went to Borders to steal their WIFI (which is free and a practice I encourage all of Australia to take up) and charge up my phone. Ordered a &#8220;Regular&#8221; hot chocolate and got something that would pass as a regular-sized softdrink in Australialand. Drunk it all a little too quickly and felt a little sick after from all the sugar, but manned up and recovered.</p>

<p>Still on Wednesday (big day), I bought a &#8220;thank you&#8221; card for one of the people who got me into Rails, Ryan Ghods. Back when I was still &#8220;doing&#8221; PHP (I use &#8220;doing&#8221; loosely because nobody &#8220;does&#8221; PHP, PHP does you. Don&#8217;t use it.) Ryan was one of the people who showed me the Rails blog screencast tutorial (the original, with the &#8220;whoops!&#8221;) and suggested I get into it. I did and I have never looked back. I wrote in the card and headed down to Palo Alto where I figured I would meet my friend like I planned and now had a dual purpose of delivering this thank you card to Box.net. I completely underestimated how long the Caltrain would actually take to get there. I honestly thought it was closer to the city, but it felt like a 40 minute journey stopping all stations. During this time I&#8217;m trying to keep up Twitter correspondence with Box.net and asked if I could visit Ryan&#8217;s brother, Sam, who works for Box.net. Unfortunately it wasn&#8217;t to be and so I just dropped the letter in the letterbox outside. Hopefully it gets to The Other Ryan intact.</p>

<p>I retreated to the Starbucks nearby without a plan of what to do next and wrote a bitchy tweet about people not checking email/twitter because I hadn&#8217;t heard from my friend who wanted to meet me that whole week. Not 5 minutes later he sends an email to me and he says he&#8217;ll be at the Nuthouse down the road in 30 minutes. I head there and think that I deserve a cider, so I ask what brands they have. The waitress replies &#8220;Apple, Pear and Raspberry&#8221;. Oh. &#8220;Apple, please&#8221;, I say, sticking to my favourites. Later on I tried the pear one which is just as good, but Raspberry? I don&#8217;t know about that. So finally Matt (the friend) and I catch up at the Nuthouse and talk shop. He name drops that Mark Zuckerburg and his Facebook comrades drop in to the Nuthouse from time to time. My jaw drops. I am in the same bar that Mark Zuckerburg drinks at and the ciders are $3.75. Holy. Shit.</p>

<p>We end up going back to Matt&#8217;s place where I meet Walter, the hyper-hyper-hyper-hyper-active Border Collie and step in one of his &#8220;presents&#8221;. Matt gets some &#8220;scalding hot water&#8221; and I pour it on my shoe to wash it away. After learning my lesson, then I take off the shoe and the steaming sock underneath and scrub the shoe with a broom brush nearby. After that incident get in his car and drive to Stanford&#8217;s bookstore which is gigantic. I&#8217;ve never seen a bookstore with a cafe AND toilets AND three floors of books. Just massive. Matt casually mentions that Stanford receives &#8220;donations&#8221; from certain members of society and that a high-profile tech guy may be sending his son there. Stanford may have a new building dedicated to a special someone soon.</p>

<p>We spent the rest of the night at the Nuthouse eating peanuts (hence the name) playing Cricket (the darts version) and 501. Mark didn&#8217;t show, but there were Facebook people all chugging beer and chanting in a booth as we walked out. Is this the Web 2.0 bubble? I stayed the night at Matt &amp; Kyle&#8217;s house, sleeping on an air-mattress in their computer room. Slept incredibly well (which seems to be a pattern this entire trip)</p>

<p>Thursday (today), I met up again with Santiago and another guy I know from the Ruby community called Mislav with Cecilia in the San Francisco mall. Santiago wanted to spend the day hacking on the Rails source so we dropped him at the Starbucks nearby and Cecilia, Mislav and I went for a long walk all the way from the mall to Fisherman&#8217;s Wharf and then on to the Golden Gate Bridge. It was getting pretty evident we weren&#8217;t going to see anything when the fog started to come in but we went there anyway. We arrived back in town at about 8pm and Cecilia and I grabbed some food from the mall again whilst Mislav went off to drop off his bag. Cecilia left before I did as I planned to stick around and wait for word on pre-GoGaRuCo drinks but then I thought better of it and ended back at home writing this lengthy piece.</p>

<p>So what do I expect over the next few days? I expect to meet a lot of people who I&#8217;ve known for a very long time over the internet (Mum always said &#8220;don&#8217;t talk to strangers&#8221; and I may have selective hearing), much like I&#8217;ve already done in the past couple of days but on a much larger conference scale. I plan on listening intently to the talks, but they&#8217;re re-watchable online (eventually), whereas the social interaction isn&#8217;t re-playable.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s going to be great. I cannot wait. I cannot sleep. I am too excited. OK, maybe I can.</p>

<p>Just not right now.</p>}]]></content>

   <title>Three Dot Oh</title>

   <updated>2010-08-30T00:00:00+10:00</updated>
   <id>http://ryanbigg.com/2010/08/three-dot-oh</id>
   <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you haven&#8217;t heard already, <a href='http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2010/8/29/rails-3-0-it-s-done'>Rails 3.0.0 was released earlier today!</a> Congratulations to <a href='http://contributors.rubyonrails.org'>all who have worked</a> on this release since December 2008. Thank you.</p>

<p>With this &#8220;final&#8221; release of 3.0.0 finally out the door, I&#8217;ve seen a great uptake of it and I&#8217;m excited to see what people do with it. Whilst it almost seems mandatory to participate in the circlejerk, I am going to take leave from it this time and delve into something else very much related.</p>

<p>Even though Rails 3 is out and we should all really upgrade our applications right now, there&#8217;s going to be some people, like myself, who are still going to be developing Rails 2.x applications. I know, right? The guy <a href='http://manning.com/katz'>writing a book on Rails 3</a> has a day job developing a Rails 2 application.</p>

<p>C&#8217;est la vie.</p>

<p>So does my friend Lucas Willett and his team at Ennova and not forgetting the fabulous <a href='http://twitter.com/jasoncodes'>@jasoncodes</a>. Tonight we were discussing, as we do, things relating to Rails. The (one-sided) conversation goes like this:</p>
<blockquote>
Lucas: sup<br />
Lucas: freaking bastard heroku<br />
Lucas: we're using [declarative_authorization] 0.5 which has only one gem dep of rails 2.1.0 and greater<br />
Lucas: so heroku decides OH SHIT<br />
Lucas: YOU NEED AREL AND ACTIVE SUPPORT AND EVERYTHING EVER<br />
Lucas: VERSION 3 OF EVERYTHING<br />
</blockquote>
<p>Lucas is an energetic kind of guy. I can imagine him typing that at no less than 546wpm, frowning intently the entire time.</p>

<p>The problem it turns out is <a href='http://github.com/stffn/declarative_authorization/blob/master/declarative_authorization.gemspec'>this glorious file</a>. Do you see any problem with it? No?</p>

<p>Not even with this?</p>
<h2>s.add_dependency('rails', '&gt;= 2.1.0')</h2>
<p>Yeah, that&#8217;s right. Greater-than-or-equal to 2.1.0. Do you <strong>know</strong> what got released today? Three Dot Oh. BOOM.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s the problem. That little dependency line&#8217;s going to want to install the <strong>latest and greatest</strong> version of Rails, which just so happens to be 3.0.0. Oops. But Lucas is still running a 2.3.x application.</p>

<p>So how do we fix this? I&#8217;m not entirely sure myself. One of the options (coincidentally the only one I can think of right now) would be to tell Lucas to use Bundler for his 2.x application like all good boys &amp; girls should be doing. Bundler would solve this problem by only loading the gems that Lucas wants. Take this (contrived) <em>Gemfile</em> as an example:</p>
<pre>
  gem 'rails', '2.3.8'
  gem 'declarative_authorization'
</pre>
<p>Bundler will <strong>only</strong> load the 2.3.8 Rails gem, regardless of what Lucas has installed. He could have every single version of Rails installed. 2.3.8 is king. When Lucas (or any code throughout his application) does something like:</p>
<pre>
  require 'active_support'
</pre>
<p>RubyGems won&#8217;t through a hissy fit similar to this:</p>
<blockquote>
  Gem::LoadError: can't activate activesupport (= 3.0.0, runtime) for ["railties-3.0.0"], already activated activesupport-2.3.8 for []
</blockquote>
<p>Bundler&#8217;s got that covered.</p>

<p>I hear you cry! You say: &#8220;But (Sir/Lord/King/Dickhead) Ryan, I thought Bundler only worked with Rails 3!!one&#8221; (for one of the exclamation points, you <strong>actually</strong> say &#8220;exclamation (point!)&#8221;). This is simply not true.</p>

<p>There are <a href='http://gembundler.com/rails23.html'>lovely instructions on how to use Bundler with Rails 2.3</a>. I would suggest that you (along with Mr Willett) read these to save yourself some potential headaches.</p>

<p>Why? Because right now if you do <span class='term'>gem install declarative_authorization</span> and you don&#8217;t have Rails 3 installed, you&#8217;ll get it installed:</p>
<pre>
Successfully installed declarative_authorization-0.5
Successfully installed activesupport-3.0.0
Successfully installed activemodel-3.0.0
Successfully installed rack-mount-0.6.12
Successfully installed tzinfo-0.3.23
Successfully installed erubis-2.6.6
Successfully installed actionpack-3.0.0
Successfully installed arel-1.0.1
Successfully installed activerecord-3.0.0
Successfully installed activeresource-3.0.0
Successfully installed actionmailer-3.0.0
Successfully installed thor-0.14.0
Successfully installed railties-3.0.0
</pre>
<p><span>dhh voice</span>WHOOPS<span>/dhh voice</span></p>

<p>So yes, the short end of this story is: use Bundler. Please? Yehuda&#8217;s put a lot of effort into it and I&#8217;m pretty confident it&#8217;s going to save you (and Lucas!) a lot of heartache in the future (of which Bundler is a big part).</p>

<p>I hope to see a lot more of you out there using Rails 3 (like <a href='http://gemcutter.org'>Gemcutter</a> is). Until then, I&#8217;ll be quietly sobbing at my desk working on this now ancient relic of a Rails 2 application. Enjoy.</p>}]]></content>

   <title>IRL Help</title>
   <link href="http://ryanbigg.com/2010/08/irl-help"/>
   <updated>2010-08-17T00:00:00+10:00</updated>
   <id>http://ryanbigg.com/2010/08/irl-help</id>
   <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m generally viewed as a Helpful Person, mostly online. But I am also generally helpful in the &#8220;real world&#8221; too. I do weekly shopping trips for the GetUp office, I get coffee and I debug &#8220;computer says no&#8221; issues. Generally a helpful kind of guy.</p>

<p>Today I was walking home and I stopped in at my local shopping center to get ingredients for my dinner, Yet Another Bachelor Meal: Tuna Patties Edition. I decided after getting these ingredients that I didn&#8217;t want to walk along Parramatta Road where all the car fumes are, but instead elected to take the &#8220;back route&#8221; which is about the same distance, but much quieter and less fumy.</p>

<p>About 500m away from the shops, I&#8217;m walking along one of the backstreets and I see this&#8230; shape&#8230; moving side to side. I didn&#8217;t know what it was. As I approach it, there&#8217;s just enough light from the streetlight on the other side of the road that I can see it&#8217;s this old lady trying to push one of the shopping trolleys from Coles.</p>

<p>As I near her, she must have heard me and asked if I could help her move her trolley. It sounded like she asked if I could move it to the bus stop. Being the generally helpful kind of guy that I am, I did that since the bus stop was about 50m up the road. I thought she was going to get on a bus and take her stuff home.</p>

<p>She looked about 70 and shuffled very slowly, using the fences and walls along the way as support. She was probably walking less than a kilometre per hour. When I moved the trolley it must&#8217;ve weighed as much as her! This thing was deceptively heavy and I was thankful that it was only to the bus stop! When I got the bus stop I looked back at her, waved &amp; shouted a goodbye and then carried on my way.</p>

<p>Not 3 steps later, dogs start barking behind me. Thinking it was just the usual racket, I keep carrying on.</p>

<p>Then the old lady shouts for help.</p>

<p>Fuck. My first thought was that she was being attacked and by the dim streetlights it certainly looked like it. She was bent over in an almost &#8220;stop biting my legs&#8221; kind of fashion and the dog was &#8220;strafing&#8221; around her and barking.</p>

<p>Adrenalin instantly kicks in. I go into Hulk Mode and run up to the dog and shout as loud as I can:</p>

<p>&#8220;Get off!&#8221; &#8220;Go away!&#8221; &#8220;BAD DOG&#8221;</p>

<p>The dog stops harassing the old lady and sets it sights on me. I can see it clearly now. It looks almost like a kelpie, but I couldn&#8217;t pick the exact breed. It starts barking at me and I bark back.</p>

<p>&#8220;BAD DOG&#8221; &#8220;SHOO&#8221; &#8220;GO!&#8221;</p>

<p>The old lady&#8217;s behind the dog, I&#8217;m at the front. I tell her to come past the dog but stay wide. It&#8217;s about at this point something ridiculous happens.</p>

<p>A guy in his mid-20s, rides past on a bike. No earphones in (this is important). I shout at him &#8220;YO! You! Need your help here!&#8221; He just keeps on riding. I want to find this guy and this dog again, and put them in a room together to let him know what it feels like.</p>

<p>For me, I was fucking terrified. I was bitten by a Terrier when I was 10 on my ring finger of my left hand. I have the scars to prove it. The dog was let off the leash and rushed up to me and grabbed my hand. Instinctively, I try pulling away <strong>whilst the dog still has a grip</strong>. I stand up and this little terrier is dangling from my finger. I don&#8217;t remember what happened next, but I know that there was a lot of blood. I didn&#8217;t want that to happen again.</p>

<p>So this old lady manages to get next to the dog all the while I&#8217;m screaming at it &#8220;SHOO!&#8221;, &#8220;BAD DOG!&#8221;. The lady gets past and we both turn our backs. I see the dog come running up beside me, still barking. This is where I thought it was going to have my leg for dinner. I turn around in Extreme Hulk Mode and shout &#8220;LEAVE NOW!&#8221;. That seems to be the magic words as the dog puts its tail between its legs and decides that tonight is not the night to fuck with the angry guy who can shout louder than it can bark.</p>

<p>The dog&#8217;s still barking as we walk off and then one &#8220;ruff&#8221; later, it stops. Peace and quiet. Some old lady two doors down is out the front of her house and me still being in Jack Bauer on Steroids Mode, say &#8220;Call the RSPCA!&#8221; like it was a matter of Utmost National Security. She replies and says she&#8217;s called the rangers many times and they won&#8217;t do anything until the dog bites somebody. Apparently the dog just roams out the front of the house, harrassing people as it walks past. I think this is strange because I&#8217;ve been down this road once or twice and never had it come to me before. I bid Elderly Lady #2 goodnight.</p>

<p>Elderly Lady #1 tells me that actually she doesn&#8217;t want the Super Heavy Maxi Trolley left at the bus stop, but she wants to take it to her house which is about 500m down the road. That&#8217;s cool. I&#8217;m still hopped up on Adrenalin and feeling like I could battle Chuck Norris and Bruce Lee simultaneously and it&#8217;d be an OK fight.</p>

<p>We walk at her steady shuffling pace for the whole time and she tells me that 9 years ago she was in a car accident, twisted her spine and damaged her hips. The legs feel fine in the morning but when she gets tired they lock up, like they&#8217;d done tonight. She seemed like she was in a lot of pain, but she was handling it well. She said that the doctors do nothing and that they don&#8217;t treat it with surgery, but rather give her pills. I guess that&#8217;s a cheaper alternative, but is it really the best? I am not one to say.</p>

<p>She keeps saying things like &#8220;thank you so much for helping me&#8221; and &#8220;I would have been stuck back there with that dog if it wasn&#8217;t for you&#8221; and I humbly accept these thanks. We talk about the dog some more and she asks what I do for a job now. I say that I&#8217;m a programmer, but I really love animals. She suggests that I should have been a vet. I would love to be one, but I can&#8217;t stand the heartbreak of losing an animal. When the family budgie died &#8211; the one we had since I was 3? &#8211; it broke my heart. Then in April at Railscamp I got the news that the family dog, Rex, was put down. He was suffering from arthritis and was blind. He was a stupid dog, but was great to have around. Veterinary isn&#8217;t for me.</p>

<p>As we cross the road she points a little way up the street and says &#8220;that&#8217;s home&#8221;. I&#8217;m thankful. Super Heavy Maxi Trolley is making me use muscles I haven&#8217;t used in probably too long. We speak some more, this time about the guy who rode past on his bike. She says that when she was younger, people always helped each other out. Now it&#8217;s all &#8220;me, me, me&#8221;. She thanks me again.</p>

<p>We come across a <strong>very</strong> friendly black cat which I use as a distraction from pushing the trolley which I temporarily leave against a wall. I stretch my arms in the guise of stroking the cat as it winds its way between my legs. The cat leaves to go rub itself on some parked cars and roll in the gutter. Cats are awesome.</p>

<p>We run out of high wall about 150m from her house and the lady grabs on to the trolley as we near our destination. &#8220;The one with the light here&#8221; she points in a narrow doorway to two units. &#8220;Number 2!&#8221; she says, almost sounding relieved. The cat&#8217;s stuck with us and proceeds to scratch at the door, and I thought it must have lived there.</p>

<p>The lady tries to get to her handbag to get the keys. The handbag is not-so-strategically placed under the heaviest bag of the bunch and when she goes to lift it I stop her and do it myself. I&#8217;ve seen people really hurt themselves by doing simple things like this, and I don&#8217;t want her to come to harm. She finds the keys and unlocks the door and the cat just saunters up the stairs. The lady tells me that the cat doesn&#8217;t live there. Hm. Then how do you get the cat out?</p>

<p>I lift her bags out of the trolley which we leave just outside her door and then I take the bags upstairs to the front door of her unit. I come back downstairs where she&#8217;s waiting and she says &#8220;I have to pay you, you have been so good to me for no reason.&#8221; I say &#8220;No, it&#8217;s OK&#8221; but she insists on giving me a scrunched up $10 note from her purse. She wouldn&#8217;t take no for an answer.</p>

<p>So the cat. I think myself a bit of an animal person and I wasn&#8217;t quite sure how we&#8217;d get it out, but apparently crouching out the front, clicking my fingers and saying &#8220;here kitty kitty&#8221; like they do in the movies&#8230; that actually worked. The cat came up and stroked itself against my arm and then rolled itself in the gutter.</p>

<p>I asked the lady if she could get up the stairs and she said yes and bid me goodnight. I walked off feeling like Rambo and <a href='http://twitter.com/ryanbigg/status/21389450867'>wrote a tweet</a> very similar in style to <a href='http://xkcd.com/77/'>this XKCD comic</a>.</p>

<p>I think at this point in time the Adrenalin has worn off. Yesterday I felt like crap. I felt <strong>alive</strong> tonight.</p>

<p>If you see someone in need, <strong>please</strong> don&#8217;t be like that jackass on the bike and keep going. Stop. Help where you can. Surely we&#8217;re all better off if we all help each other rather than being pathetic self-serving bastards? We are all human. We should show compassion to all those around us. As the note right above the handle on my bedroom door says: &#8220;Be awesome always.&#8221;</p>

<p>TL;DR: I helped an old lady with her really heavy shopping trolley. A dog heckled her and I vocally bitchslapped it into submission (all the while feeling like Jack Bauer talking down a terrorist). Then an awesome black cat came up and was really friendly. I may have used up my Adrenalin allowance for the entire year.</p>}]]></content>

   <title>Moving Out: For Reals</title>
   <link href="http://ryanbigg.com/2010/08/moving-out-for-reals"/>
   <updated>2010-08-09T00:00:00+10:00</updated>
   <id>http://ryanbigg.com/2010/08/moving-out-for-reals</id>
   <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I promise I&#8217;ll get back to the technical side of things soon. If you&#8217;re reading this in desperation for more technical goodness I hear there may be <a href='http://manning.com/katz'>a book that will sate your appetite</a>.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve been thinking for the past couple of days of all the different possible combinations of what could happen. It effectively boils down to three options:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Marcelo and Larissa get the place they applied for and we all move out together. Rent will be cheap but there are 3 other people I'd be sharing a house with: Marcelo, Larissa and Adrianna (the reason I'm moving out in the first place). They like parties, I don't.</li>
  <li>Marcelo and Larissa <strong>don't</strong> get the place they applied for, and then we're stuck in the sticky situation of me calling back my rental buddies saying things like "You know how I said I didn't need that place? I actually do need it." then them saying something like "It's been taken" and me pulling a GIGANTIC SADFACE.</li>
  <li>I move out to Narwee with one of the rental buddies I found on easyroommate.com.au, Tim.</li>
</ol>
<p>The third option to me sounds like the best and most sensible right now. In hindsight, I don&#8217;t know why this solution wasn&#8217;t obvious from the beginning. If I move out of this place and Marcelo and Larissa don&#8217;t get the place they applied for then it frees up the room for Adrianna to move into. I get to move to a new neighbourhood with a person with similar interests and perhaps meet some new people. I also free Tim of a roommate who&#8217;s a bit of a &#8220;daddy&#8217;s girl&#8221;. A definite win-win-win.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ll be out of here in probably two weeks, catching the train into work which is awesome since being on the train will give me more time to do writing / other things.</p>

<p>Exciting times!</p>}]]></content>

   <title>Moving Out: The Reckoning</title>

   <id>http://ryanbigg.com/2010/08/moving-out-the-reckoning</id>
   <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I wrote a post last weekend saying that my housemates were asking me to move out so that their cousin could move in. Since then, I&#8217;ve looked at about 6 different places throughout the week like:</p>

<ul>
<li>A place in Surry Hills on the 7th floor of an apartment building</li>

<li>Tiny little room in a terrace in Surry Hills</li>

<li>A largeish room in Five Dock, but way way waaay away from public transport</li>

<li>A medium-sized room in Narwee, with a really awesome guy</li>

<li>A tiny room in Summer Hill</li>
</ul>

<p>I got all these contacts through the sites <a href='http://gumtree.com.au'>Gumtree.com.au</a> and <a href='http://easyroommate.com.au'>Easyroommate.com.au</a>, and it&#8217;s a really easy process. Just getting to the places take a while.</p>

<p>I met quite the broad spectrum of people and was keen on moving to Narwee since that was the most affordable and the guy was a linux sysadmin (this is the part where you berate me for not stepping outside my comfort zone, and where I counter-claim that comfort zones exist for reasons you <em>just wouldn&#8217;t understand</em>).</p>

<p>Then as I was going between places today my current housemates text me with a whole slew of pictures showing an awesome 3 bedroom house that we can all move into basically around the corner from where we&#8217;re at right now. First bedroom&#8217;s for them, second for their cousin and third for me, so it all works out well. And with 3 different &#8220;groups&#8221; paying the rent, it&#8217;s going to be way cheaper than any of the other places. So I think I&#8217;ll be sticking with these guys since they&#8217;re only thinking of having it for the short term (until December) anyway. It&#8217;s great that I get to stay with Marcelo and Larissa, I really enjoy their company.</p>

<p>Of course by me now staying with them, I now have to phone up the people who I&#8217;ve &#8220;interviewed&#8221; with over this past week and tell them all &#8220;thanks but no thanks&#8221;. That&#8217;s a &#8220;tomorrow job&#8221;, for certain. Totally buggered tonight.</p>

<p>It&#8217;d be nice having a little bit of certainty for my future, but I should know by this stage (after moving interstate twice in two years) that certainty is only a word, and would never be more than that. Nothing is certain, everything changes, and you just have to deal with it. This is just another one of those things. Next year I may even be in another country. I&#8217;m cool with that. Parents may not be, however.</p>

<p>So I&#8217;m here until December at least, and then after that I guess I&#8217;ll go all mercenary and sell my soul / body to the highest bidder / most awesome looking place. Who knows? Nothing is certain. Everything changes.</p>}]]></content>

   <title>Moving out</title>

   <id>http://ryanbigg.com/2010/08/moving-out</id>
   <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>At the beginning of the week my housemates and I chat and the conversation was basically thus:</p>
<blockquote>
Housemates: "Ryan we love you (as a housemate) and we found this awesome 3 bedroom place in Ultimo, wanna come with us? It's big!"<br />
Me: "OMG YSPLZ" (I work in Surry Hills)
</blockquote>
<p>I went through the week thinking I was doing well with my housemates.</p>

<p>I come back this afternoon from a shopping trip and the conversation goes like this:</p>
<blockquote>
Housemates: "Ryan, our cousin is being kicked out because he had an argument with her housemate and we're thinking of letting her move in here."<br />
Me: "That's OK, we have the spare bed."<br />
Housemates: "No... could you leave in 4 weeks time so she could move in? She's family. Please?"<br />
Me: "..." (but in my head there was <a href='http://hachidori.org/blog/images/fffuuuuuu.png'>this</a>)<br />
Me: "Ok, I will see what I can do." (but in my head <a href='http://www.gymidiots.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/son-i-am-disappoint.gif'>this</a>)
</blockquote>
<p>So I find myself in quite the fun situation again of having to look for a new place. I&#8217;ve re-opened my ad on easyroomate and hopefully I&#8217;ll get as many bites as I did last time. I&#8217;ve also been applying for some places and I got a pretty alright hit rate from that last time too. We&#8217;ll see how things go this time.</p>

<p>So in 4 weeks time, I&#8217;ll be out of this place and in my new one. I&#8217;ll be sad to leave Marcelo and Larissa, but I suppose I do have to get out and explore some more.</p>

<p>Some may view this as a dickish move, but I don&#8217;t. I understand where they&#8217;re coming from. I hope them all the best and I have no bad feelings towards them.</p>

<p>I just hope I don&#8217;t end up like <a href='http://www.kavistechnology.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/istock_000001389194xsmall.jpg'>this</a>.</p>}]]></content>

   <title>Helpdesk</title>
   <link href="http://ryanbigg.com/2010/07/helpdesk"/>
   <updated>2010-07-27T00:00:00+10:00</updated>
   <id>http://ryanbigg.com/2010/07/helpdesk</id>
   <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I am your helpdesk.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s right. Me. The Ruby programmer who works by day and writes by night and helps you out in between (and sometimes in dreams).</p>

<p>You come to me with your computer troubles and most of the time you leave without them. I usually am quite happy to help you, but I must confess my motivations are entirely selfish. I help you to help me.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;ve got a problem and you don&#8217;t know how to fix it then you approach me (or in the case of my day job, one of the tech team). This is because I&#8217;m perceived to &#8220;know about computers&#8221; even though I specialise in Ruby and web development. Sometimes it&#8217;s not even computers. Sometimes your router was connecting to the internet and &#8220;now it just doesn&#8217;t, I did nothing I swear!&#8221;.</p>

<p>So you&#8217;ve got a problem. Ok. What&#8217;s the end goal? Are you trying to open a file? Connect to the internet? Build a death ray? Good. We&#8217;ve got that sorted. Ok, what could possibly be wrong? Is the file corrupt? Are the cables connected properly? Did you forget to turn it on?</p>

<p>I&#8217;ll go through the steps I know that should work because I&#8217;ve done this before. Why have I done it before? Because I&#8217;ve been there. Because I&#8217;ve seen someone else do it. Because I just have an uncanny knack for Figuring Shit Out. Somewhere along the line, something isn&#8217;t quite right. We&#8217;ll work through it and at the end of it I&#8217;ll explain what the problem was and you&#8217;ll nod your head in agreement and wait patiently for me to finish explaining things and then I&#8217;ll go away feeling like I&#8217;ve helped somebody.</p>

<p>Later on down the line when I encounter this issue, I&#8217;ll know how to fix it. Because I&#8217;ve been there before. By helping you, I help me.</p>

<p>So when the little prissy web developers tell stories of being approached by their computer-illiterate co-workers and being asked for help&#8230; they tell the story in such a fashion:</p>
<blockquote>But I'm a web developer, not helpdesk! Just because I know *something* about computers doesn't mean I know everything! Why are they coming to me?</blockquote>
<p>Well listen up, softie. They&#8217;re coming to you because they respect your opinion. They think you have the brains required to solve this little issue and it shouldn&#8217;t be below you to help them out.</p>

<p>Do it. Contribute back to the world in that little fashion by showing them that the USB cable doesn&#8217;t go into the network plug (uh huh, I&#8217;ve seen it and check for it now) and that it actually goes in this smaller rectangular socket. And don&#8217;t do it condescendingly. Take them through the steps they need to know in order to fix it so that they can do it in the future and perhaps show somebody else.</p>

<p>Perhaps you&#8217;ll learn something in the process.</p>}]]></content>

   <title>I'm Wanted</title>
   <link href="http://ryanbigg.com/2010/07/im-wanted"/>
   <updated>2010-07-24T00:00:00+10:00</updated>
   <id>http://ryanbigg.com/2010/07/im-wanted</id>
   <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Within 24 hours of announcing <a href='http://ryanbigg.com/2010/01/why-mocra-is-awesome/'>I left Mocra</a>, I received many, many job offers and it astounded me. It astounded me that I was so <strong>wanted</strong> by people from <strong>around the world</strong>.</p>

<p>They came from near and far and I ended up picking <a href='http://groups.google.com/group/rails-oceania/browse_thread/thread/ce9aa2e9a56f0ebe'>a 3 month contract with GetUp</a> in Sydney. I loved what I did at Mocra, but I love what I do at GetUp more. Both Mocra and GetUp are superb and really, really passionate about what they do.</p>

<p>I started on 22nd February and I&#8217;m still working there. What was originally a &#8220;3 month contract&#8221; has now turned into an 8-month contract, with the possibility of being extended even further than that. I&#8217;ve taught the team Ruby on Rails the best way I know how (inspired by Dr. Nic &amp; my experiences at Mocra) and we&#8217;re rockin&#8217;. Still. I get up (no pun intended) in the morning and go &#8220;I <strong>have</strong> to go to work&#8221; not &#8221;<span>groan</span> I <strong>have</strong> to go to work.&#8221; At least, most days.</p>

<p>Then in April, shortly after I return from Scotland, I get contacted by <a href='http://manning.com'>Manning Publications</a> who ask me to be a co-author for no book other than <a href='http://manning.com/katz'>Rails 3 in Action</a>. That morning I bounced off the walls. Overjoyed is an understatement. Think teen girl at Justin Bieber concert and you&#8217;re getting about a tenth of the way there. I love writing and I love teaching.</p>

<p>So I took that job up too, along with the GetUp job. It&#8217;s been a while since I&#8217;ve juggled two jobs (since my Coles/PHP freelancing days) but I&#8217;m handling it surprisingly well and I think it&#8217;s mostly in part to the awesome teams I work with for both of them.</p>

<p>But by the end of the year, there&#8217;s a huge chance that I&#8217;ll be done with both of them. I will have taught the GetUp team a lot of what I know about Ruby on Rails (and they&#8217;ll have taught me some too!) and I will have finished and published the book.</p>

<p>So then what? Well, that part&#8217;s up for debate.</p>

<p>On one hand, staying in Australia would be great because I have a lot of friends here and I&#8217;m generally well-known to get work if I need it. But you could apply that to the other hand too.</p>

<p>The other hand, I&#8217;m famous &#8220;online&#8221;. I even have <a href='http://twitpic.com/285uam'>a shirt</a> that says it. I could probably get work anywhere in the world, and I&#8217;ve received a couple of offers from places like the US, Denmark, Scotland and London. But, these are all development-only jobs. I much prefer a decent mix of teaching and developing, or maybe even both at the same time. I feel by teaching new people that they will go out and teach more people. If I&#8217;m developing, I&#8217;m not widening the pool of available developers and not helping the community grow. This is something I really want to do.</p>

<p>What I&#8217;m looking for in a job <strong>isn't full-time development</strong>. <u>My ideal "job" is going around the world teaching people about proper Ruby on Rails development and about proper Agile development.</u></p>

<p>I want to be able to teach people. To watch them grow. For them to say &#8216;aha!&#8217; when they finally get a concept. For them to teach me new things. For us to develop something really great.</p>

<p>For now, I am happy working at GetUp. If they want me to stay on longer then I&#8217;m very inclined to say yes. If they don&#8217;t, then it&#8217;s been fantastic.</p>

<p>My contract with GetUp runs out at the end of October. 3 months from now.</p>

<p>If you want me to help your team <a href='mailto:radarlistener@gmail.com'>now's the time to let me know.</a></p>}]]></content>

   <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>After going to Scotland in March and attending the very awesome Scottish Ruby Conference I still feel like travelling. For quite a long time I&#8217;ve wanted to go to San Francisco and check out the Ruby scene there and I also have a couple of people who I&#8217;d love to catch up with in other parts of the country. So I&#8217;m going to be doing an &#8220;American tour&#8221;.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m thinking of flying in on the 15th September, staying for 2 weeks and leaving on the 29th or 30th. So far I&#8217;ve planned as far as attending GoGaRuCo (probably not speaking, unless they want me to) and perhaps spending a day or two in SF going to bug the EngineYard and GitHub guys.</p>

<p>After that? I&#8217;ve got invites to go visit people in Indiana, Ohio and Florida and so that&#8217;s what I&#8217;ll be doing. No specific dates yet, but there&#8217;s definitely a whole slew of people from the Ruby community who I&#8217;d love to meet.</p>

<p>Thanks to the people who have already offered accommodation! In my single overseas trip experience so far, this takes a <em>lot</em> of hassle out of doing it!</p>

<p>I&#8217;ll see you when I get there!</p>}]]></content>

<p>It&#8217;s been a fun process writing the book so far.

   <title>uninitialized constant RSpec with Cucumber</title>
   <link href="http://ryanbigg.com/2010/07/uninitialized-constant-rspec"/>
   <updated>2010-07-05T00:00:00+10:00</updated>
   <id>http://ryanbigg.com/2010/07/uninitialized-constant-rspec</id>
   <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today I upgraded the Cucumber gem on my system (still had 0.7.something) only for it to break!</p>

<pre><code>uninitialized constant RSpec (NameError)
/Library/Ruby/Gems/1.8/gems/cucumber-0.8.3/bin/../lib/cucumber/rb_support/rb_language.rb:51:in `enable_rspec_expectations_if_available&#39;</code></pre>

<p>I saw this error last week on a workmate&#8217;s computer and both times it was fixed by removing the <code>rspec-expectations</code> gem which is a part of the RSpec 2 gem collection. I had these left over from when I was playing around with Rails 3 (now I&#8217;m using RVM). The latest version of Cucumber maintains compatibility between these two versions and does so by trying to require <em>rspec/expecatations</em> which will be available if the <code>rspec-expectations</code> gem is installed. So if you&#8217;re trying to use RSpec 1 and 2 and Cucumber at the same time, you may run into this issue. So far the best solution I&#8217;ve found is uninstalling <code>rspec-expectations</code>.</p>

<p>Just thought I&#8217;d let you know. It&#8217;s bitten us twice and may bite you.</p>}]]></content>

   <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The Australian Government <a href='http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/technology/blogs/the-geek/internet-freedom-in-2010-looks-like-1984/20100618-ykr9.html?rand=1276822049429'>has put forward a scheme which they wish to log the activity of every user of the internet</a>. What. The. Fuck?</p>

<p>Must the government fear its citizens so much that it has to monitor their every movement? Lucky we have a lot of spare land to put the datacenters where to keep this new data they&#8217;ll be storing. This means data such as sixteen-year-old girls &#8220;liking&#8221; a picture on Facebook and writing comments like &#8220;omg hayley wat r u doing dere?&#8221;. Seriously, Australia? Fuck.</p>

<p>Again, it&#8217;s also a load of bullshit. Like the internet filter. People who want to keep their communications secret (VPN / SSL anyone?), will do it. The government <em>must</em> find an alternative solution that doesn&#8217;t involve tracking miniscule internet movements of the majority to capture such an infinitesimally small minority. One person&#8217;s a terrorist and suddenly we&#8217;re all suspected of it until proven innocent.</p>

<p>This is not the &#8220;democracy&#8221; I&#8217;ve grown up knowing. It&#8217;s, in the words of Muse, &#8220;demonocracy&#8221;.</p>

<p>It makes me sad that we have a bunch of old fogeys in their ivory towers scheming against the majority without asking it for their opinion. I thought that&#8217;s what democracy was about. I wish they&#8217;d climb to the highest level of their tower and defenestrate their pathetic ideas, followed shortly by theirselves.</p>

   <title>Bridging the Gap</title>
   <link href="http://ryanbigg.com/2010/06/bridging-the-gap"/>
   <updated>2010-06-07T00:00:00+10:00</updated>
   <id>http://ryanbigg.com/2010/06/bridging-the-gap</id>
   <content type="html"><![CDATA[<strong>The question is: How do we bridge the gap between newbie and experienced in such a way that we wont suffer the talent drought we are currently facing. What are your thoughts as to how we can fix this?</strong><small>This post was intended as a script for a videocast, but I'm a horrible actor.</small>
<p>Hello!</p>

<p>My name is Ryan Bigg. You may remember me from such hits like #rubyonrails, Railscamp or the Scottish Ruby Conference. I&#8217;m here today to talk to you about something that I perceive as a problem. Firstly though, a bit of backstory.</p>

<p>The Ruby (and Rails) communities are some of the most supportive and inviting communities on the planet. When I started with Rails, my first question in the #rubyonrails IRC channel was about an error I was getting, an undefined method &#8220;find&#8221; on a class called &#8220;Thread&#8221;. Little did I know back then that Thread is a reserved class in Ruby. As you can see from this example, I too was a noob.</p>

<p>Since then, my Ruby skills have flourished to where I think I&#8217;m growing to be a Ruby expert. I still hang out in IRC channels and sometimes I&#8217;m asked for advice and if I&#8217;m free I&#8217;ll help out. So why do I do help? I am not a religious person, but there are some certain aspects of particular religions I believe in, such as karma from Buddhism. To me, karma means that if I do something good to somebody, then eventually something good will happen to me and vice versa, I do something bad, bad things will happen. I also believe in &#8220;paying it forward&#8221;, that if I help somebody out, then perhaps they&#8217;ll see somebody else with the same or a similar problem and help them out, too. So I help out in the hope that 1) I improve somebody else&#8217;s life just that little bit, 2) I may improve my knowledge of a particular concept or problem and 3) eventually that good deed will come back to me.</p>

<p>I didn&#8217;t get good at Rails overnight. Nobody gets good at anything overnight, unless you&#8217;re Neo from the Matrix or Yehuda Katz. It&#8217;s taken me 3 and a half years to get to this point and I fully believe it was because I spent time helping people solve their own problems which allowed me to build up a great database of Ruby-knowledge that I could apply to any application I worked on. Working with a team of already-experienced developers greatly assists here too and I am thankful of the time I spent at SeaLink, NetFox and Mocra and freelancing. Before Mocra I didn&#8217;t even use Cucumber! Now I&#8217;m writing a book centered around using it to develop a Rails application! It&#8217;s great! The things you learn on the job are more important, than the things you do on the job. I got lucky. I attended a Ruby meetup back in April 2007 in my hometown of Adelaide where I was invited to work for either SeaLink, NetFox or another company Freerange Future. When I begun working for SeaLink, I had only been in the Ruby and Rails world for 8 months, and during 8 months at SeaLink, I learned a lot about Ruby, about Rails and about RSpec. Working with Rails has definitely been one of the greatest ways to learn about it.</p>

<p>Now in 2010, as a writer of a book aimed at a wide range of Rails people (newbies and up), the experiences of new people is something I&#8217;ve been considering for a while. The way I have visualised the community for a long time now, is a pyramid. The bottom is, of course, wider than the top and the lower down the &#8220;pyramid&#8221; you are, the less skill you have and of course the higher up this &#8220;pyramid&#8221;, the more skill you have. The width of the pyramid at any level indicates how many people there are at that level and, because the Ruby community is growing, there&#8217;s a lot more inexperienced people than there are experienced. If the Ruby community was shrinking, you&#8217;d see the opposite effect where there&#8217;s a wider level at the top of the pyramid dwindling down to nothing at the bottom. No new people means a dying community. Ruby is not dying. So how are newbies to gain the experience required to work towards the top of this pyramid and get hired by the companies looking for &#8220;experienced Ruby / Rails developers&#8221;? It&#8217;s simple: they&#8217;re going to need a job. So it saddens me to see all these companies hiring &#8220;experienced&#8221; Rails developers.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s only so many &#8220;experienced&#8221; Rails developers. They&#8217;re being snatched up by companies quicker than they&#8217;re becoming available. I know this because the company I&#8217;m working for right now is trying to hire a new &#8220;experienced&#8221; developer and we&#8217;re having an absolute bastard of a time. We&#8217;re also down one developer because he has RSI, and another was just pulled off my team to work on the legacy application until the election. So we&#8217;re looking to hire an &#8220;experienced&#8221; Rails developer to fill the gaps. It&#8217;s almost as if there&#8217;s no more &#8220;experienced&#8221; developers left to hire in Sydney and I&#8217;ve seen this same situation in Brisbane, where I used to live and other people have talked to me about it too. We need an &#8220;experienced&#8221; developer because we&#8217;re looking to get this application done by the Federal Election. But there are seemingly none left. So what can be done about this? How can we and other companies find new members for the team?</p>

<p>Well, we could bring in a new person, but we (as a company), but not I (as a &#8220;teacher&#8221;), don&#8217;t want to spend time teaching new people when that time could be used for developing new features. Why should you pay somebody when you&#8217;re teaching them? Shouldn&#8217;t it be them paying you? Well, no. You&#8217;re paying them in the hope that they&#8217;ll stick around and provide another valuable resource to the company. Some do, some don&#8217;t. Give them the incentive to stick around and I&#8217;m sure they will. Job security is a great incentive. I think we need more companies who aren&#8217;t all just about the &#8220;gogogogo&#8221; and are actually conscious about the future of their business. If the future involves hiring a new developer and having to train them up in a language, why not do it? Sure, you&#8217;ll lose one developer&#8217;s time for a short while, but what you&#8217;ll gain in the long term is two developers&#8217; time. Then that developer can teach more people you bring in. Eventually, you won&#8217;t be understaffed.</p>

<p>If you hire nobody, then that&#8217;s the worst thing that can happen. You&#8217;ll overwork your developers and you&#8217;ll think that they underdelivered because they didn&#8217;t do a good enough job, but the reality is it was because they were under-resourced. You put a magical deadline on them and expect it to be done but the harsh truth is: sometimes deadlines aren&#8217;t met. Budget some money, and some time, to bringing new people way before any major deadlines if that&#8217;s what it&#8217;s going to take to be successful in the long run. Over-estimate how many people you&#8217;re going to need to get the project done. That&#8217;s what you want, isn&#8217;t it? A completed project? Therefore, we shouldn&#8217;t be hiring &#8220;experienced&#8221; people only but rather people who can contribute back to the team, even if that involves having to teach them something first off.</p>

<p>Personally, If I were to hire a new person, there&#8217;s a couple of things I&#8217;d be looking out for. Before I list them, here&#8217;s a very good point of a conversation I had last night with a Rails developer based in California, Keyvan. Keyvan got started with Rails in December. He said that in order to be good at Rails, he didn&#8217;t need the knowledge of the ins-and-outs and every single class and method. You just need to know how to do your research (aside: and not to cargo-cult!) and learn to learn. If you&#8217;re able to absorb the knowledge and make it into your own from the resources like people and the Internet, then you&#8217;ll go pretty far. Now Keyvan is doing Rails work for many clients and is gaining a reputation for his work. What I&#8217;m looking for in a person isn&#8217;t experience in a language, but rather the same ability Keyvan has. The ability to learn. The ability to understand. The ability to apply yourself to accomplishing something. These are the major concerns that I&#8217;d be for. Other things include the standard: good communication skills and good personal hygiene.</p>

<p>I want to see that drive in people, that willingness to learn. Another example. A friend of mine, Bo, introduced me to a .NET developer friend of his, Lucas. One day last year, we showed him what Rails can do. Lucas attended the ActionHack events that are held monthly in Brisbane as well as the last two Railscamp events. Not because he had to. Because he <em>wanted</em> to. He attended these events because he wanted to learn, and that&#8217;s precisely what he&#8217;s done. He&#8217;s learned Rails, learned BDD concepts and now knows enough to be hired by a Rails shop. Lucas is in the same group of people as Keyvan.</p>

<p>I know there&#8217;s a vast group of these people out there, just looking for some company to give them a chance at developing Rails, but all the companies out there are hiring &#8220;experienced&#8221; developers. I haven&#8217;t seen a single job posting in the past couple of months on the rails-oceanic list looking to hire people that they&#8217;re willing to teach. Because everyone wants things done now. Nobody is willing to invest in the future of the community. What we need is some&#8230; group to invest time teaching these new people. That&#8217;s what I&#8217;d love to do. I love seeing people&#8217;s faces light up when they discover something or hearing that &#8220;oohhhhhhh&#8221; when something clicks. For now, I&#8217;m doing the best I can. I am personally considering after I&#8217;ve finished writing this book to approach some universities or TAFE colleges and asking them about how I can go about teaching them, hopefully they can give some pointers.</p>

<p>So in summary: this has been a question that&#8217;s been floating around in my head for ages: How do we bridge the gap between &#8220;newbie&#8221; and &#8220;experienced&#8221; in such a way that we won&#8217;t suffer the talent drought we are currently facing. What are your thoughts as to how we can fix this?</p>}]]></content>

   <title>Using Cucumber tables to specify associations</title>
   <link href="http://ryanbigg.com/2010/06/using-cucumber-tables-to-specify-associations"/>
   <updated>2010-06-04T00:00:00+10:00</updated>
   <id>http://ryanbigg.com/2010/06/using-cucumber-tables-to-specify-associations</id>
   <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>How many times do you use Cucumber to seed data by using a step such as this:</p>

<pre><code>And there is a list:
  | name          |
  | GetUp people! |</code></pre>

<p>Probably a lot, right? Good. Then this post is probably for you.</p>

<p>How many times have you done it and needed to specify an association in there too? Like this:</p>

<pre><code>And there is a list:
  | name          | parameters[email_contains] |
  | GetUp people! | getup                      |</code></pre>

<p>Probably a couple of times.</p>
<h3>So what can be done?</h3>
<p>As you may know, by using this syntax in Cucumber you get a variable which I always call &#8220;table&#8221; in my steps. You may call it something else. What matters is that it&#8217;s a <code>Cucumber::Ast::Table</code> object that has a method called <code>hashes</code> on it. This will return a <code>Hash</code> object for every single row minus one in your table. The minus one is the first row &#8211; the header row &#8211; which provides the keys for the hash. The remaining rows are the values for each of the hashes. In the first example, our hash is:</p>

<pre><code>{ :name =&gt; &quot;GetUp people!&quot; }</code></pre>

<p>In our second example, our hash is:</p>

<pre><code>{ &quot;name&quot; =&gt; &quot;GetUp people!&quot;, &quot;parameters[email_contains]&quot; =&gt; &quot;getup&quot; }</code></pre>

<p>Bah! This won&#8217;t do!</p>
<h3>Enter <span class='term'>to_query</span></h3>
<p>There&#8217;s a lovely method on <code>Hash</code> that will allow you to convert any <code>Hash</code> object to query parameters. It&#8217;s called <code>to_query</code>. The second Hash <code>to_query</code> output is this:</p>

<pre><code>&quot;name=GetUp+people%21&amp;parameters%5Bemail_contains%5D=getup&quot;</code></pre>
<strong>Eeew!</strong><h3>Query strings are not pretty</h3>
<p>So to deal with query strings, Rack parses them into a <code>Hash</code> object (and Rails, a <code>HashWithIndifferentAccess</code> object) using the lovely <code>Rack::Utils.parse_nested_query</code> method. This forms the query string into the <code>params</code> hash which we have come to know and love. The very same <code>params</code> hash you use to create objects with.</p>

<p>See where I&#8217;m going with this? Great!</p>

<p>So we define our step like this:</p>

<pre><code>Given /^there (is|are)\s?a?\s?lists?:$/ do |is_or_are, table|
  table.hashes.each do |hash|
    List.create!(Rack::Utils.parse_nested_query(hash.to_query))
  end
end</code></pre>

<p>The regular expression is to match &#8220;there is a list:&#8221; or &#8220;there are lists:&#8221;, in case we want to create more than one. By passing in the parsed hash (and because we&#8217;re using <code>accepts_nested_attributes_for</code>, the model is actually ListParameter<strong>s</strong>), we&#8217;re able to create not only the new <code>List</code> record, but also assign the <code>ListParameter</code> record too.</p>
<h3>Not only for <span class='term'>belongs_to</span></h3>
<p>You can also assign <code>has_many</code>s through this too, although the syntax is a little bit more uglier. Again, providing you&#8217;re using <code>accepts_nested_attributes_for</code> for the <code>has_many</code> association, this should work just as well as if you posted it from a real form.</p>

<pre><code>  And there is a link:
    | url               | clicks_attributes[0][user_id] |
    | http://google.com | 1                             |</code></pre>

<p>How about that?!</p>}]]></content>

   <title>The Rails 2.3.x Release Process</title>
   <link href="http://ryanbigg.com/2010/05/the-rails-2-3-x-release-process"/>
   <updated>2010-05-25T00:00:00+10:00</updated>
   <id>http://ryanbigg.com/2010/05/the-rails-2-3-x-release-process</id>
   <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In my <a href='http://ryanbigg.com/2010/04/when-rails-3-is-due/'>When Rails 3 is due</a> post, I note all the dates where the Rails versions have been released. Since it&#8217;s posting, have updated my prediction for a release candidate of Rails 3 to be RailsConf. It all makes logical sense that at Rails&#8217; biggest event they would do this. But can we, as a community, get it polished before then? I hope so!</p>

<p>This post is not about Rails 3, however.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s about the release process of the 2.3.x versions of Rails, specifically the process behind the latest <strong>four releases</strong> for this particular branch. The latest version, as of this writing is 2.3.7 and is unusable. 2.3.8-pre1 is out, and I suggest trying your applications on that and seeing if anything breaks. As a recap: <a href='http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2009/11/30/ruby-on-rails-2-3-5-released'>2.3.5 was released in November of <strong>last year</strong></a>, <a href='http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2010/5/23/ruby-on-rails-2-3-6-released'>2.3.6 this weekend just gone</a>,<a href='http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2010/5/24/ruby-on-rails-2-3-7-released'>2.3.7 yesterday</a> and <a href='http://rubygems.org/gems/rails/versions/2.3.8.pre1'>2.3.8.pre1</a> shortly thereafter.</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s begin with what pre-releases are for: they are for people to test them to ensure that the final release is &#8220;smooth&#8221;. If you want to contribute to Rails: spend some time from your week ensuring your application runs on the latest version of Rails and <a href='http://rails.lighthouseapp.com'>report any problems</a>. It&#8217;s not hard to create a branch and do this. If you are one to ignore pre-releases, then you are not one who should be complaining when things break in the final version of your application. In almost every case, your application will work. You may get the &#8220;off-suit draw&#8221; and something breaks. <a href='http://rails.lighthouseapp.com'>Report your problem</a>.</p>

<p>A problem occurs when patch releases are made without any pre-releases at all.</p>

<ol>
<li>
<li>6 was released <strong>without a pre-release</strong>. Whilst this is may be perceived as a <em>catastrofuck</em> for some people, it was a long time due. The prior release, 2.3.5, was released almost dead-on six months ago. Six months between releases, in the Rails world, is a long time. Things have been progressing rapidly, and a lot of people will benefit from the changes introduced by these new versions, including support for rack and thin 1.1.0. Yes, now you&#8217;ll be able to run your Rails app by using Thin.</li>
</li>
</ol>

<p>However, 2.3.6 broke HAML <a href='http://twitter.com/nex3/status/14549663207'>which Nathan Weizenbaum tweeted about</a>. He later said he had worked around it <pre class='markdown-html-error' style='border: solid 3px red; background-color: pink'>REXML could not parse this XML/HTML: 
&lt;a href=&apos;http://twitter.com/nex3/status/14551076330&apos;&gt; and contributed back to Rails in &lt;a href=&apos;http://github.com/rails/rails/commit/e3f14d12cdad03a2294c8f7d4e170bbaecefe098&apos;&gt;these&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&apos;http://github.com/rails/rails/commit/e53791f8c06cad94f69789143e442e9866f9dfe0&apos;&gt;three&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&apos;http://github.com/rails/rails/commit/48fbe7b0d8fcecce200ea35f46a8716077e13aea&apos;&gt;commits&lt;/a&gt;. Jeremy Kemper (bitsweat) then thought that there should be a 2.3.7 release.</pre></p>

<p>Unfortunately this <a href='http://github.com/rails/rails/commit/e3f14d12cdad03a2294c8f7d4e170bbaecefe098'>first commit</a> broke Rails view helpers &#8211; such as <code>form_tag</code> &#8211; for those who didn&#8217;t have the <em>rails-xss</em> plugin installed. Jeremy missed this, and I spoke with him earlier and from what I could determine he missed the bug because he had <em>rails-xss</em> installed. When people upgraded to 2.3.7, there was <a href='http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2010/5/24/ruby-on-rails-2-3-7-released'>an outcry</a> started. A few people announced this issue, and therefore 2.3.7 was broken.</p>

<p>Whilst Rails is pretty exceptionally tested, it&#8217;s not 100%-watertight. Would this have happened if there was a pre-release? Yes and no.</p>

<p>On the yes side of the fence, people generally view pre-releases as &#8220;potentially unstable&#8221; and won&#8217;t upgrade their application, therefore they won&#8217;t upgrade. I implore you: upgrade your application <strong>locally</strong> to these new versions and run your tests. You do have tests, don&#8217;t you? Then if it breaks: <a href='http://rails.lighthouseapp.com'>report your problem</a>. Patches very, very, very welcome.</p>

<p>On the no side, there is that handful of people who do test new releases when they come out. Therefore, this issue may have been raised if there was a pre-release. We can&#8217;t know for sure.</p>
<a href='http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2010/5/25/ruby-on-rails-2-3-8-released'>2.3.8 was released a couple of hours ago</a>
<p>With this release, now we&#8217;ve got an up-to-date stable 2.3.</p>

<p>Ladies and gentlemen, <strong>upgrade your apps</strong>!</p>}]]></content>

   <title>The Present</title>
   <link href="http://ryanbigg.com/2010/05/the-present"/>
   <updated>2010-05-22T00:00:00+10:00</updated>
   <id>http://ryanbigg.com/2010/05/the-present</id>
   <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>About 6 months ago, <a href='http://drnicwilliams.com'>Dr Nic</a> and I were in the local-to-work bookstore for a reason I can&#8217;t recall. What do I recall though is the good Doctor ripping a book off the shelves and saying &#8220;You&#8217;re buying this book. Then you&#8217;re going to read it.&#8221;. This book was &#8220;How to Win Friends and Influence People&#8221; and it is in my (and millions of other&#8217;s) opinion(s) one of the greatest books ever written. It was written by Dale Carnegie in the 1930s and the wisdom in the words still holds true to this day. The foundations of human interaction has not changed much since those days, and it should not. I read the book, and it changed my perception of human interaction. I&#8217;m currently in the process of reading it again.</p>

<p>When I was in Scotland, I think on the Saturday before I left, I did to Sam what the Doctor did to me: pulled the same book off the shelf and said &#8220;You&#8217;re buying this book. Then you&#8217;re going to read it.&#8221; Sam whinged about paying for a book, so I paid for him. Then we took it home and it sat on the bookshelf in my temporary room for the next couple of days.</p>

<p>On the Monday, Sam had to take care of a couple of things for his new job and left me to my own devices. I took the book, a (&#8220;borrowed&#8221;) pen and my camera and went around town taking photographs. When my fingers got too numb from the cold, I stopped in at Costa for a hot chocolate and decided to write in the cover of the book. I&#8217;ve decided to post it here too because I feel some parts could apply to a greater &#8220;audience&#8221;. Here&#8217;s what I (hand)wrote:</p>
<pre class='markdown-html-error' style='border: solid 3px red; background-color: pink'>REXML could not parse this XML/HTML: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
[page 1]&lt;br /&gt;
To Sam,&lt;br /&gt;
Be decisive!&lt;br /&gt;
Smile!&lt;br /&gt;
Enjoy life &amp; friends&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Please read this cover to cover. It is not intended as a slight on your awesome personality, but rather intended to suggest more ways you can be [much more] awesome. After reading it, you may realise you have done &quot;the wrong thing&quot;. This is not the case, usually. We all do &quot;the wrong thing&quot; without realising it, and after reading this I often find myself thinking of how to be more patient and courteous to those around me, defusing otherwise emotional battles with people.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I have greatly enjoyed my time in Scotland with you and your family. Such generosity is rare and absolutely priceless in today&apos;s world. If any of you wish to visit Down Under, I will do anything in my power to help you enjoy it.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
[Page 2]&lt;br /&gt;
&quot;He who can do this, has the whole world with him.&quot;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Process what other people say before formulating a reply, and never interrupt them. Think of how you&apos;d feel if the tables were turned.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
[Page 3]
I trust by now you are already bored of my scrawl. I would just like to say thanks again.&lt;br /&gt;
And again.&lt;br /&gt;
And again.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
We all have the potential to be great/fantastic/awesome, so why not? Why not try improving somebody else&apos;s day? Give them a compliment (hint: girls like compliments on what they are wearing. A wolf whistle is &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; a compliment!). Perhaps if you improve their day, it may improve your day, or even your life. Take advice. Embrace the world&apos;s knowledge. Use it to &lt;strong&gt;your&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;everyone around you&apos;s&lt;/strong&gt; advantage. This includes your parents who quite obviously love you very much. Just remember what I said.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
[Page 4]&lt;br /&gt;
Your parents have been around for &lt;strong&gt;twice&lt;/strong&gt; as long as you have and have a great deal of knowledge. You may find, like I did, that co-operating with them is much easier than arguing. They only have &lt;strong&gt;your best interests&lt;/strong&gt; in mind. They are great, but also as mortal as the rest of us. They will not be around forever. Enjoy as much time as you can with these fabulous people before you are unable to!
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be kind (aka, keep going)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What can you give others&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Take advice and use it!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Read this book!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
So long, Sam.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;</pre>
<p>After I finished writing it, I put my spare travel money card in the middle and then snuck it into Sam&#8217;s bookshelf. When I left for home, I told him where I left it. He&#8217;s read it already cover to cover and appreciated my &#8220;foreword&#8221; and the book itself.</p>

<p>I really enjoyed Scotland and I wish Sam (and his family) all the best.</p>}]]></content>

   <title>Recruiters: Know Thy Recruitees</title>
   <link href="http://ryanbigg.com/2010/05/recruiters-know-thine-recruitees"/>
   <updated>2010-05-21T00:00:00+10:00</updated>
   <id>http://ryanbigg.com/2010/05/recruiters-know-thine-recruitees</id>
   <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I suppose I&#8217;m well-known (at least in the Australian community) on <a href='http://groups.google.com/group/adelaiderug/browse_thread/thread/4f237e79bd9872c0/2da2cfe763287585'>my stance on bad recruiters</a>. To me, their job is to perform the most minimalistic effort possible to get people for other companies and in doing so, they line their pockets with a nice pay packet. I even <a href='http://ryanbigg.com/job-postings/'>wrote what I look for in a job posting</a>. It&#8217;s not difficult to &#8220;bait the line&#8221;. Spend that little bit of effort.</p>

<p>Recruiting sounds like quite the fantastic job and I&#8217;m sure that if I wasn&#8217;t teaching/coding at GetUp or writing a book, I would be &#8220;farming&#8221; people and then getting them hired at companies looking for developers and getting a nice pay packet from these companies from providing them with valuable people. In theory, anyway. I really feel there is a nice market here. It would be a bridge between those looking for Ruby on Rails training and those looking for experienced people.</p>

<p>I honestly appreciate those companies that have gone out of their way to contact me personally with job advertisements or offers. These companies know that if they want the best talent, that they&#8217;re not going to get it through some recruitment firm. The company knows what they are looking for, and therefore will (or at least, should) be actively involved enough in the community to know who&#8217;s available when. Sometimes I have not been able to consider them because I have been employed at the time, and others would have caused large changes, such as moving to another continent! When I announced I left Mocra, I had a lot of people contact me directly for job offers. I&#8217;m sure that if, today, I was to announce that I&#8217;m leaving GetUp (clarification: I&#8217;m not. At least not in the next month.), these same people and perhaps more would contact me with further work. Being in demand is a great feeling. I haven&#8217;t had to stress about job security because I know that if one job doesn&#8217;t work out, there&#8217;s always more.</p>

<p>You&#8217;re probably thinking I&#8217;m not very loyal. I am, but there are certain conditions that apply. For instance, you cannot buy my loyalty. If your job sucks, then I&#8217;m not going to enjoy myself doing it and will probably be looking for a way out. Give me something to do that I enjoy along with enough money for me to be able to pay the rent and enjoy my chosen lifestyle, and that&#8217;s how you can have my loyalty. Mocra kind of did this (I hear the situation has improved). GetUp does this.</p>

<p>So why don&#8217;t recruiters bait their lines when they go fishing for new people? Take this email I received on the 18th of May from a recruiter from an American recruiting company:</p>
<blockquote>
Hi Ryan,

I'm recruiting for [list of big companies], and others. I ran across some of your Open Source work and wondered if you would be interested in chatting about a new opportunity.

Having published open source code is a big plus for all of these companies! If you're interested in discussing, please let me know.
</blockquote>
<p>Where&#8217;s the bait? What in this email is supposed to make me want to drop absolutely everything I&#8217;m doing now, start hyperventilating and type a response to this email? It&#8217;s sadly absent. I sent a reply anyway (typical nerd, desperate for more human interaction).</p>
<blockquote>Yes I'm interested in discussing this with you, always good to talk to people who know what's out there. When would you like to talk?</blockquote>
<p>I say I&#8217;m interested (just window shopping for now) and ask when would be an appropriate time for <strong>them</strong> to speak to <strong>me</strong>. Business 101: cater to the other person. Think of what you can do to benefit them and then go about doing it.</p>

<p>So by now you may have realised that the 18th of May was 3 days ago. Which is ancient in email world. It had scrolled right to the precipice of my inbox and last night I saw it sitting there, mixed in with all the lighthouse notifications. They hadn&#8217;t replied in those 3 days. Maybe they sent it out to a lot of people and were busy. Whatever the reason, I decided to write again:</p>
<blockquote>
Hi [name], I'm still interested in discussing this with you. I am disappointed that you have not yet gotten back to me. Hope to hear from you soon, Ryan Bigg
</blockquote>
<p>And within 4 hours of my reply, they wrote back:</p>
<blockquote>
My apologies for not getting back to you.  Are you interested in relocating out to Silicon Valley, or for a telecommuting opportunity?  
</blockquote>
<p>I sleep with my iPhone in my bed running the Sleep Cycle app. I&#8217;m a stats fanatic. This morning I slept well. But I digress. Because my iPhone is so accessible and my computer is all the way on the other side of the room (about 1m from the end of my bed), I read my emails on my phone. The email that they wrote fit all on one &#8220;screen&#8221;. Again. No bait. Oh, &#8220;Silicon Valley&#8221; is supposed to be bait? Nah uh. I leapt (well, more of a roll) out of bed and almost tore open my macbook lid. I am in the mood for writing. Can you tell? So I wrote them back the kind of sized reply which I think is reasonable.</p>
<pre class='markdown-html-error' style='border: solid 3px red; background-color: pink'>REXML could not parse this XML/HTML: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Hi there,

&lt;p&gt;
I am going to need more information before I can give a solid reply on that. Here&apos;s some thing&apos;s I am interested in about finding out about a job before making any decisions:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
* The name of the company interested in hiring me. Unless [their company] is going to hire me to work for them directly, this is not you. It could be one of the companies you are doing the recruiting for, in which case I scouts-honor-cross-my-heart-and-hope-to-die promise you I won&apos;t give away the name.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
* What kind of work I would be required to do (For example, I am more keen on teaching people who are new to Ruby on Rails more than doing the coding myself. The open source work I have done is because it was something I was interested in at the time and I never intend for them to become successful viable products. Anyone who does open source and hopes for this to happen is, in my opinion, crazy.)
&lt;p&gt;
* The language I would be required to program in. I am proficient in Ruby on Rails (and therefore, by extension, just Ruby itself) but I am willing to learn other languages. If I had to learn another language would I be provided with on the job training?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
* Are there any other skills require to perform this task? For example, at my current job (a contract that expires next month, fyi) I simply do not just teach Ruby. This of course means that I have to have the ability to work closely and patiently with other people on a project in order to meet deadlines. Then there&apos;s the database work which involves data integrity, really fast database inserting and so on. Then there&apos;s the &quot;magnum opus&quot; of the system which is getting that data from the database and into 500,000 emails which are to be sent out in under an hour. All of which I feel I&apos;m very capable of doing.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
* If I were to relocate to the Silcon Valley, would the company I relocated for cover my all my relocation costs, part of them, or none of them?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
And of course the final point which anyone would be stupid not to ask:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
* The fancy word is &quot;remuneration package&quot;. I&apos;d like to call this &quot;The number that determines what can I afford to eat, do and play&quot;. I am of course talking about a salary. Would I be paid a competitive salary, or would I be on enough to afford half a packet of ramen noodles for dinner each night and maybe the flavour packet if I was feeling really hungry? If you are concerned that you cannot answer this question clearly, given that &quot;competitive&quot; means very little in this context, I am currently on around [pay]. Can you do that, or, preferably, better?
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Looking forward to hear back from you once more,&lt;br /&gt;
Ryan Bigg
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;</pre>
<p>All of this information should have been provided as the bait from the original email. Now I am slightly annoyed that I have had to spend time helping them do their job correctly.</p>

<p>About an hour later, they replied with an email that answered my questions to the best of their ability. A nice big (seriously) non-sarcastic bravo! <strong>this</strong> is the kind of effort I&#8217;m talking about!</p>
<blockquote>
Hey Ryan, good questions! I'll try to answer them all.
<p>
I mentioned the name of some of the companies in my first email. I am currently working with: [big companies]. I'm working with a few other companies as well but the ones mentioned are hiring the most. I look for the same thing for of these companies: Strong OO Development skills and a genuine interest in technology.
</p>

<p>
What you would be doing depends on the company and position. My approach here is to get you in touch with company and the engineering teams directly. That way you can discuss your interests and their requirements without a non-technical recruiter (me) getting in the way! ;). Strong OO development skills, strong interest in technology, ability to write "elegant" code that scales. These are the same requirements I have from most of my clients. In the case of [big company] for example, what you would actually be working on is not pre-determined but will be figured out during the interview process.
</p>

<p>
The languages vary. I will say that in the companies I've mentioned, none of the positions state Ruby or RoR as a requirement. C++/Python would be the most common combination in terms of requirements. Javascript is also pervasive throughout all of these companies. Most of these companies want people who can adapt quickly to new languages.
</p>

<p>
Knowledge or understanding of what makes code expensive (in terms of resources) and how to make applications scale is the single most important additional skill. 
</p>

<p>
Relocation expenses. This again depends. This is part of what we would help to negotiate for you. In most cases, some sort of relocation packing would be included.
</p>

<p>
Compensation. Yes, if you were made an offer by one of these companies, I would expect it to exceed [rate] USD. Again, this will depend on your interview. Salary negotiations are something we can assist with as well. Average salary for a software engineer with 5+ years of experience is between $90,000 and $130,000 USD per year. 
</p>

<p>
The next thing I would need is your CV/Resume. You're[sic] github profile looks great! Once I review your resume I can give you more specific info on what companies and positions I think would be best.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now we&#8217;re talking.</p>

<p>When I was initially contacted to write this book, this is the email they sent me:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
I am writing you as an [position] with [company]. We are currently looking for a writer to [contribute to] our book on Rails 3. I came across your blog and thought you might be a good fit.
</p>

<p>[redacted awesome things that may give away too much information]</p>

<p>Would you have any interest in joining this project? Please let me know. I look forward to hearing back from you, and would be happy to speak with you further about the book.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Bam! Straight to the point! I just about damn near well bounced off the walls when I read this email the first time. I still get giddy now reading it. We played email ping pong for about 5 volleys with the slowest turnaround being about 12 hours (because, occasionally, I sleep) This is the kind of recruitment I want to see more of! Be proactive and entice the people you want to hire. Bait the line.</p>

<p>Recruiters: know thine recruitees. When you go looking for new hires, give them a reason to leap out of bed and feverishly reply to your email. Just FYI: if I receive another email of this first email&#8217;s &#8220;standard&#8221; again, I&#8217;m not going to feel like replying as quickly as I did when I read the book email. If you&#8217;re not going to spend the time to write something detailed, then I am not going to spend the effort to write something back.</p>

<p>Do your job, and do it well or go away.</p>}]]></content>

   <title>Do It Again</title>

   <id>http://ryanbigg.com/2010/05/do-it-again</id>
   <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today was utter crap.</p>

<p>It wasn&#8217;t crap when I woke up. It was just another day. What woke me up at the semi-pleasant hour of 5am was my publisher calling. We had scheduled a call for 6 but I think he may have suffered from an &#8220;off-by-one&#8221; error. People make mistakes and I silently forgave him for this and talked business for 21 minutes. We&#8217;re making fantastic progress. I really felt good after this morning&#8217;s conversation.</p>

<p>Then I spent the next 3 and a half hours before work exhausting all my news sites and chatting with Sam Elliot (lenary) for an hour about a multitude of things. <a href='http://hypernumbers.com'>Hyper Numbers</a> came up. I wrote them <pre class='markdown-html-error' style='border: solid 3px red; background-color: pink'>REXML could not parse this XML/HTML: 
&lt;a href=&apos;http://gist.github.com/405662&apos;&gt; and &lt;a href=&apos;http://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/c5p56/html_is_dead_spreadsheets_for_life/&apos;&gt;posted it on Reddit&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&apos;http://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/c5p56/html_is_dead_spreadsheets_for_life/c0qanc2&apos;&gt;they replied later on in the day&lt;/a&gt;. I do see their point and I wish them well. Shame about the &quot;code bukkake&quot; though.</pre></p>

<p>Then I went to work on my boss&#8217;s boss&#8217;s bike (loaned to me last Friday) and ding&#8217;d my bell at a couple of pedestrians and had the usual &#8220;not looking where I&#8217;m going so I&#8217;m just going to walk straight towards your bike in the hope that you swerve and miss me&#8221; occasions. This is what happens when you ride on footpaths. Oh, I should ride <strong>on the road</strong>? Have you <strong>seen</strong> Sydney peak hour? I value my life.</p>

<p>The first half of work, usually called &#8220;morning&#8221;, was good. We finished a feature yesterday and begun working on a new one, refunding donations, today. New features are always good to get rolling. The idea was to have the full refund done by the end of the day. What we&#8217;re currently working on is called &#8220;v3&#8221; or &#8220;version 3&#8221; or, if you&#8217;re keen on the buzzwords, &#8220;MVP&#8221; for &#8220;Minimal viable product&#8221;. What this acronym and term means varies from person to person, day to day and even weather condition to weather condition. It effectively means the application needs to be &#8220;good enough&#8221; for us to run an election campaign on. I won&#8217;t bore you with the technical details and only mention that it&#8217;s been in planning as early as January this year. With the election not yet having a set date (there&#8217;s rumours which boss^2 likes parading about), it&#8217;s hard to know when we&#8217;re going to have to release this thing. For as long as I&#8217;ve worked there, it&#8217;s been &#8220;before the election&#8221;.</p>

<p>Last week we were given a deadline. A specific time at the end of June. Right, that&#8217;s still a while off, right?</p>

<p>Boss^2 looks panicky.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are we going to get this done by that date?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How long do you think this will take?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What can we cut out of this to make it by then?&#8221;</p>

<p>All questions he asks. As a developer, I can say &#8220;that&#8217;s going to take <pre class='markdown-html-error' style='border: solid 3px red; background-color: pink'>REXML could not parse this XML/HTML: 
&lt;number&gt; &lt;timeframe&gt;&quot;. </pre></p>

<p>Boss^2 takes it as gospel. It has to be done by that date. Otherwise, disaster. The world is exploding. Next he knows, Tony Abbott will be PM.</p>

<p>Boss^1 acknowledges there is a deadline and also acknowledges that our estimates are&#8230; estimates, and that things can go wrong and things can get delayed and we can make up the time later on by developing it smarter (by writing tests).</p>

<p>I like Boss^1.</p>

<p>But Boss^2 is a realist. He feels that if this project doesn&#8217;t get off the ground that he may have to scrap it. Yes, this project that I&#8217;ve worked so diligently on for the past 3 months will be scrapped in favour of their old, kludged-together (but functional, kinda like my old VL Commodore) PHP system. Yeah.</p>

<p>So this afternoon we had an hour long meeting. An hour of time that could, in my opinion, have been better spent developing. We knew what needed to be done. We knew there was a deadline. All information conveyed in that meeting could have been done through an email exchange or, Hell, on Google Wave. I took notes. Especially of Boss^2&#8217;s lines. Such as &#8220;let&#8217;s assume we have design&#8221; and &#8220;let&#8217;s just park that issue&#8221;. Another golden one from this morning &#8220;I want you to work on that operationally&#8221;. Speak. Clearly. Please.</p>

<p>The other non-developer in the meeting, a senior campaigner, wore what I&#8217;ll refer to as his &#8220;sadface&#8221; throughout the meeting. I don&#8217;t like seeing people in that state. They want this new system, and we are working bloody hard to develop it.</p>

<p>As for the first line: We <s><strong>cannot</strong></s> <strong>must not</strong> assume we have anything at the moment. What if our designer is unavailable?</p>

<p>At the end of the meeting (at 5:15pm) I was drained. Did I mention I woke up at 5am? That probably didn&#8217;t help things. So I packed my things and headed home, it was the end of my day. I wheeled out the bike and took it down the elevator. Then I rode down Foveaux Street and waited at the lights to cross to go past Central. I hopped the traffic island on my bike and the back tyre blew. I checked it and it was a clean tear. I hadn&#8217;t bought a spare. Hindsight&#8217;s a bitch.</p>

<p>That was it. I&#8217;d had enough. I put the bike up against one of the columns and threw down my helmet and put both hands on the column and bowed my head for a couple of seconds. What a crap day. I phoned Francois (one of the ex-PHP coder&#8217;s who&#8217;s coming along well!) and thankfully he was still in the office. Took the bike back up Foveaux street (it&#8217;s a hill) to the office and left it in the &#8220;foyer&#8221; and took the stairs down to ground.</p>

<p>Then I caught a cab from the taxi &#8220;station&#8221; nearby, only to realise peak hour traffic is crap. You&#8217;d think with me walking alongside a main road just about every night for the past couple of months I&#8217;d know this. I got the driver to drop me off near Broadway supermarket. There they have a butcher that sells a &#8220;New York&#8221; steak. It&#8217;s the perfect size. I bought one and some potatoes, and now if you excuse me I&#8217;m going to go make the best fucking steak ever, eat it, and then just sit and think for some time. Think that, if I could do this day again with the knowledge I have now, what would I do differently? How can I make tomorrow better? And then just not think at all.</p>

<p>tl;dr: Book is going awesome. This week: work has sucked. Boss^2 is great source of buzzwords. My bike back tyre blew. I&#8217;m eating awesome steak to recuperate.</p>}]]></content>

   <title>Rails 3 Book: Staying Focussed</title>
   <link href="http://ryanbigg.com/2010/05/rails-3-book-staying-focussed"/>
   <updated>2010-05-10T00:00:00+10:00</updated>
   <id>http://ryanbigg.com/2010/05/rails-3-book-staying-focussed</id>
   <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Sometimes I have difficulty focussing on tasks and getting things done. I think that this is part of being human. There are some times where I will concentrate on a task so fiercely that I will ignore other things, such as that bad smell coming from the laundry basket in the back corner of my room. Then there are the times where I&#8217;m as apathetic to the task as a teenager to homework. I&#8217;ve been asked by a couple of people how I stay so focussed.</p>

<p>What&#8217;s my secret?</p>

<p>I break everything down into tiny chunks so my tiny brain can understand that, in order for there to be &#8220;happy happy joy joy fun time&#8221; this one little task needs to be done. In the process of writing, I&#8217;ve broken the book down into individual stories, just as a real app would be broken down. Each chapter can (and so far, all of them do) contain many stories. So far the average is 4, but with only two &#8220;storied&#8221; chapters written, this is an unfair average. The purpose for breaking it down into stories is two fold: <ol>
  <li>As mentioned before, it demonstrates to the reader how a real application would be developed using BDD. Story by story.</li>
  <li>It "forces" the user to concentrate on just getting one "puzzle piece" done at a time</li>
</ol></p>

<p>There&#8217;s also the top-secret 3rd &#8220;fold&#8221;: It helps me focus when I&#8217;m writing. If I know that there&#8217;s writing to be done (and boy (and girl), there&#8217;s writing to be done!) and I&#8217;m going &#8221;<em>groan</em> more writing!&#8221; I have the willpower to convince myself that if I can write a well-done story tonight it is one more story closer to completion than if I had not. That is enough to convince me that I should probably do some writing. I don&#8217;t have to write the WHOLE chapter in this one sitting. Just this one story. Then I can take a break and give it a skim-through to see if there&#8217;s any glaring omissions and fix them. Then I may even be eager enough after that to take <strong>another</strong> break, perhaps to go to the toilet or grab some food or do that washing that&#8217;s creating that God-awful smell. Anything that let&#8217;s me <strong>just think</strong> about what I&#8217;m doing for a moment, that&#8217;s a good thing. That&#8217;s one less distraction that I&#8217;m going to have when I enter the zone. I&#8217;m not going to think &#8220;I should eat&#8221;, because I already have. Deal with the distractions, then get on with it.</p>

<p>With this &#8220;technique&#8221; applied three weekends ago (a long weekend in Aussie-land) I managed to write nearly 16,000 words. Two weekends ago was my brother&#8217;s birthday, which was fantastic to see him and the rest of the family again. Nothing got done that weekend besides awesome catch up. Then this weekend, I wrote <strong>another</strong> 14,000 words. Between these periods I&#8217;ve been doing some self-editing and editing based on the suggestion of Others Who Cannot Be Named. This has left the total word count at 29,101 as of tonight.</p>

<p>Tomorrow night is the Ruby on Rails Sydney meetup which I&#8217;ll be at so there&#8217;ll be no writing done then, but it&#8217;s <strong>extremely</strong> likely that I&#8217;ll be at the magical 30,000 word mark come headdown (the time when my head hits my pillow) on Wednesday. And then beyond that. Eventually though, there will come a time where I will get to release this to you guys. That&#8217;s when I feel I won&#8217;t be writing as much, just fixing up what&#8217;s already been written. We&#8217;ll see. Perhaps I&#8217;ll feel ultra-motivated and get to that mystical target I&#8217;ve set myself of 20,000 words in a weekend. It&#8217;s a nice sounding number.</p>

<p>So in order to be ultra-focussed I deal with all possible distractions before starting tasks. I&#8217;m finding this is an effective way of being able to stay focussed for long periods of time, and I&#8217;m curious if this works for you too. I know other people use techniques like timeboxing and Pomodoro.</p>

<p>What works for you?</p>}]]></content>

   <link href="http://ryanbigg.com/2010/05/listen-to-us"/>
   <updated>2010-05-07T00:00:00+10:00</updated>
   <id>http://ryanbigg.com/2010/05/listen-to-us</id>
   <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>From my time helping out in the #rubyonrails channel on Freenode, I have come across some awesome people whom I probably would have never met. Being able to talk with them is the major reason why I still hang out in there. Then there&#8217;s the coming and going of the people wishing to ask questions and listen to the answers provided by the people who are willing to give them, such as myself.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t mind answering question after question when I have spare time (<a href='http://ryanbigg.com/2010/04/rails-3-book/'>which I don't anymore</a>, so I cut back). Some of the questions are nearly identical such as &#8220;Has anybody used <pre class='markdown-html-error' style='border: solid 3px red; background-color: pink'>REXML could not parse this XML/HTML: 
&lt;x&gt;?&quot; or &quot;Can somebody help me?&quot; or &quot;This is broken.&quot; This is why I made the &lt;a href=&apos;http://github.com/radar/railsbot&apos;&gt;bot for the channel&lt;/a&gt; so that the people helping out do not have to repeat themselves. The bot provides many things, such as the commands `!used`, `!ask` and `!elaborate` for the responses to the respective questions above. I think it&apos;s a great advantage having something like that in the channel and I can see that other people do too.</pre></p>

<p>Sometimes though, we have to answer the questions ourselves. The channel bot does not have the knowledge we do, and is really only helpful for answering general questions or linking to helpful things like the guides. When we answer these questions, we (read: most of us) put our heart and soul into helping you become a better person. We give <strong>free</strong> advice to those who ask for it.</p>

<p>Many of these people are thankful, grateful, appreciative. I want to see these people become contributing members to the Rails community, so I help them. This is how I got started, and how I <em>need</em> them to get started too. In helping these people, perhaps I learn something new, or perhaps I don&#8217;t. It&#8217;s those little things you pick up along the way by helping out others which I think makes me a great programmer. The feeling you get when somebody says &#8220;Thanks&#8221; when you help them is awesome. If I didn&#8217;t need to eat, sleep or drink, I could probably live off this alone.</p>

<p>Then you get the people who question your advice. Who state, adamantly, that your advice is wrong. Very, very, very rarely this is the case. It&#8217;s usually that they&#8217;ve come in with their own set opinion and that anybody else who says anything different is completely wrong. I do not understand these people. They come in asking what <em>appears</em> to be a legitimate question, but instead will argue with you for hours as to why their point is better, regardless of your experiences and issues with their point.</p>

<p>Listen to us. We&#8217;ve been there before. We know what&#8217;s best (99.999% of the time). If you think that you&#8217;re right, stop and think for a moment. What if the other person is right? Try to see it from their point of view. Imagine what it would be like to argue their point. Don&#8217;t come back with things like &#8220;NO THAT SUCKS&#8221;. Clearly elaborate on why it sucks in clear and concise points. Text is not limited and your time is not as precious as you think. The more valid points you have for your argument, the better it will be. Arguing with the longtimers in the channel is not the way to win friends and influence people. Admit you&#8217;re wrong if you are, and you&#8217;ll be a better person for it.</p>

<p>Stop assuming that your answer is the be-all-and-end-all of the topic. Why waste our time asking a question if you&#8217;re already set in your ways? Just go and implement it and then come to us later when it breaks for you and <strong>we will help you fix it <em>for free</em></strong>. If 5 other people in the channel are opposing your idea and suggesting what they claim is a better solution, then they&#8217;re probably right. We only have your best interests in mind.</p>

<p>Please, listen to us. We want you to help you, help us, help you.</p>}]]></content>

   <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I <a href='http://ryanbigg.com/2010/05/rails-3-book-week-3/'>mentioned yesterday</a> that I was saving juicy topics for the book I&#8217;m writing, but this is just one that&#8217;s too good to miss from posting here too. Consider it (and the posts before it) a sample. The book is in a very similar vein.</p>

<p>Today we were working on our application at work which we refer to as three-point-oh. In three-point-oh, there were some features that were broken unrelated to the work we were currently doing on the <code>donations</code> branch which we had just merged into <code>master</code>. It was one of those issues where you could run the features that were breaking by themselves and they&#8217;d work just fine.</p>

<p>You know the type.</p>

<p>In our system we have an <code>ActivityObserver</code> which creates an <code>Activity</code> record every time someone performs any kind of CRUD action upon any observed class in our system. The catch is that <code>User.current_user</code> must be set for an activity record to be created, otherwise there&#8217;s no record of CRUD.</p>

<p>One of the observed classes was <code>Contact</code>. One of our features runs the <code>db:seed</code> task for its own setup (the very first line of the Background) and in this we set up a <code>Contact</code> record for the scenarios. Of course by it being the first line, we&#8217;re not going to have a currently logged in user, and therefore an <code>Activity</code> record is not going to be created.</p>

<p>But what happens if we run another scenario where we log in? Well, then <code>User.current_user</code> will be set to that user whom we log in with. Then, of course, Cucumber will perform its dutiful task once the scenario has finished running and clear the database, thereby eradicating all records, including the one that <code>User.current_user</code> is set to . What Cucumber does (and should) not do is destroy objects. When we ran the features in a group, if any of those features were logging in they would be setting <code>User.current_user</code>, then of course that related record would be being wiped when the scenario completed.</p>

<p>Then came the seeding feature. This is the feature that runs the <code>db:seed</code> task for itself and because <code>User.current_user</code> was set in a prior ran feature, it was creating <code>Activity</code> records for users that no longer exist. When the app then went to display these activities on the homepage, it would attempt access the <code>avatar</code> method on a user that no longer existed, thus giving us an <code>undefined method avatar for nil:NilClass</code>.</p>

<p>This was because between requests in test mode, <strong>classes are not reloaded</strong>. Therefore, <code>User.current_user</code> would not be unset. To unset it, we specify this in a file located at <em>features/support/start.rb</em>:</p>

<pre><code>Before do
  User.current_user = nil
end</code></pre>

<p>We could probably also use foreign key constraints to ensure that when we create an activity record that the user record we&#8217;re creating it for exists, but that&#8217;s information probably best kept for the book or another blog post.</p>}]]></content>

Now I&#8217;m looking to put the final touches on the book and because I was slightly inebriated when I got home I decided to record something in Photo Booth rather than writing it down.</p>
<a href='http://vimeo.com/11354142'>So here it is</a>
<p>Hopefully with your feedback by the end of next week I should have a good enough table of contents to start writing this epic.</p>

   <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s plugin / gem pimping time!</p>

<p>I started writing <a href='http://github.com/radar/by_star'>by\_star</a> back in November 2008 when Thomas Sinclair asked me if I could write a method that could find records for a given month. I was in my gem creating phase then so I created a gem called by_month and Thomas paid me for it (the sucker!).</p>

<p>Later on, I realised that by_month wasn&#8217;t good enough so I added a couple more finders to it. Then I added some more. Now you can find by all of these things:</p>

<ul>
<li>A given year</li>

<li>A given month</li>

<li>A given fortnight</li>

<li>A given week</li>

<li>A given weekend</li>

<li>A given day</li>

<li>The current weekend</li>

<li>The current work week</li>

<li>The Past</li>

<li>The Future</li>

<li>Between certain times</li>

<li>As of a certain time</li>

<li>Up to a certain time</li>

<li>Before a specific record</li>

<li>After a specific record</li>
</ul>

<p>So if you&#8217;re ever doing anything in your application where you need to find by dates / times, why are you not using <a href='http://github.com/radar/by_star'>by\_star</a>? Here&#8217;s a good reason you should be using by_star:</p>
<strong>Before by\_star</strong>
<pre><code> Post.all(:conditions =&gt; [&quot;created_at &gt;= ? AND created_at &lt;= ?&quot;, &quot;01/01/#{Time.now.year}&quot;.to_time, &quot;31/01/#{Time.now.year}&quot;])</code></pre>
<strong>After by\_star</strong>
<pre><code>Post.by_month(1)</code></pre>

<p>This is only a <strong>taste</strong> of the shiny things in by_star! Use it!</p>}]]></content>

<blockquote>
Yup, you heard it here: <strong>Im going to take on writing a book</strong>. This is why I want you all working on Rails and the community, because I simply will not have the time to sit in the IRC channel or on Stack Overflow to help you out anymore. Somebody else needs to step up and be me temporarily if I am to complete this book by the end of the year. I want your feedback on this! So contact me on twitter or e-mail me with ideas of what you think should go in a book about Rails.
</blockquote>
<p>I am going to be writing a book about Rails 3 and I have a general idea of what should go in it (tests first, deployment to heroku and document databases, to name a few things), but what would really make this book worthwhile to all is <strong>your opinion</strong>. I did mention that <a href='http://twitter.com'>Twitter</a> and <a href='mailto: radarlistener@gmail.com'>email</a> were fantastic ways to reach <strong>me</strong>, but really I&#8217;d rather a discussion for this, so I created a new <a href='http://uservoice.com'>UserVoice</a> account for this. It&#8217;s called <a href='http://rails3book.uservoice.com'>Rails 3 Book</a> and I&#8217;d really like to hear from you about what you think should go in this book.</p>

<p>So far I have a very, very basic Table of Contents. It&#8217;s going to be a long process, but a very, very exciting one. I look forward to working with you on this book and I hope that you buy it when it comes out.</p>}]]></content>

   <title>I want you to give</title>
   <link href="http://ryanbigg.com/2010/04/i-want-you-to-give"/>
   <updated>2010-04-19T00:00:00+10:00</updated>
   <id>http://ryanbigg.com/2010/04/i-want-you-to-give</id>
   <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Greetings. I want to &#8220;answer&#8221; to you as I feel you deserve an answer for my previous post.</p>

<p>I won&#8217;t start this post with a terrible analogy. I will use swear words throughout though.</p>

<p>I will, however, start it with an apology. The apology is for my <a href='http://ryanbigg.com/2010/04/want-it-give/'>most successful post yet</a>. I am honestly sorry for anyone that was offended by the language of the post. Let me explain my thoughts, and I hope we can resolve our differences.</p>

<p>It was positively successful. It drove a lot of traffic to my blog which is what all bloggers truly want: to be noticed. To have people leaving comments. To have an effect on the world around them. If you want to really, really hurt a blogger: <strong>stop reading what they write</strong>. Your &#8220;un-attention&#8221; is blogger Kryptonite. To those who have commented positively on not only this post, but any other post on this blog, thank you. You give me the motivation to continue writing.</p>

<p>Then there was <a href='http://twitter.com/ericflo/status/11977342737'>the negative reaction</a> that I did see coming, but did nothing to prevent it. I welcomed it. Simply put: negative reactions are more noticed than positive reactions of the same strength.</p>

<p>I will dip into my history as a supermarket checkout attendant again here temporarily. I would receive thanks from the customers who I served regularly. I thought I was good at my job. The people whom I worked with thought I was good at my job. But when a customer complained that I packed something incorrectly, that&#8217;s when the shit hit the fan. I would be brought into the manager&#8217;s office and we would have a discussion about ensuring that <strong>all</strong> customers are happy. This is impractical. We are all humans, and therefore we make mistakes, or take offense to something when there was never any given. It only takes a <strong>small negative thing</strong> to set off a large enough reaction that you&#8217;ll tell you friends about it, where as it would take a <strong>huge positive thing</strong> for a similar-sized reaction to occur. Never, ever, was I called into the manager&#8217;s office for him to compliment me on any of the exceptional things I did. He was an asshole.</p>

<p>As a programmer, I attempt to see the logic in everything. I can understand that, for example, when I press the &#8220;a&#8221; key on my keyboard, that an &#8220;a&#8221; is going to appear on the screen, always. It&#8217;s just logical. This is why I sometimes get frustrated with human behaviour, as it is illogical. My intention for the post was to get people interested in working on <strong>the core of Ruby on Rails</strong> rather than the ecosystem around it. You cannot have a stable ecosystem without a stable core. Yes, you are correct. I was arrogant in my post. But I implore you to think of it from my side of the fence. I am trying to convey a point. To get some motion going. Do you honestly think my post would have generated that much traffic had I been saying things such as &#8220;Hey guys, there&#8217;s 900 open tickets in Ruby on Rails. Would you mind, you know, taking some time out of your very, very busy schedules and fixing it&#8221;? I think not. Before you go reaching for that comment form, read that again.</p>
<strong>I think not.</strong>
<p>The operative words, of course, being &#8220;I think&#8221;. You know this. I don&#8217;t need to explain this to you. I am not stating it as fact that the post would not have been successful had I used positive terminology rather than the words I used. It is simply my interpretation. You have yours, and I have mine. I willingly used terminology that was offensive to evoke a large enough response in order to get some more eyes on Rails tickets.</p>

<p>I want to thank those of you who reacted negatively to this post, too. Why? You guys are the ones who generated the media coverage. You got it very highly ranked on the <a href='http://reddit.com/r/ruby'>Ruby subreddit</a>, <a href='http://news.ycombinator.com'>Hacker News</a> and many other technology media sites. You are the people who I want to talk to the most. You are the ones who have great ideas of how I could better go about conveying my point, and I have talked with some of you, such as Eric Florenzano. Eric was the writer of <a href='http://twitter.com/ericflo/status/11977342737'>the aforementioned "Axe body spray" tweet</a>. I politely asked him if I could email him, and he said yes and so <a href='http://ryanbigg.com/transcripts/eric-florenzano.html'>I've posted the transcript</a> if you would like to have a read. This is the kind of back-and-forth I am really looking forward to having with you all.</p>

<p>Then finally, my favourite response of all from this post was from a guy called Matthew Joiner (yes, I did my research too ;)) who was the only person out of all 10,000-and-something unique visitors to my blog to track down my email address and write me an email. Matthew starts off his email like this:</p>
<blockquote>
No one special sending you a random email, I know how people hate it, but I also am not really into commenting on blog posts, so I hope this doesn't annoy you too much.
</blockquote>
<p>When I read this, I was annoyed. Annoyed because he thought I would be annoyed! Why would sending me an email, annoy me? I want you to notice me. The one way you can inform me that you&#8217;ve noticed something that I&#8217;ve done is to email me. You can also buy me cider in real life (FYI, favourites so far are Magners and Aspley and Scrumpy Jack). I digress. You can come up to me at any of the Ruby/Rails meetups I go to and shake my hand and say &#8220;I really liked that.&#8221; It&#8217;s my fuel. I want to be noticed. Maybe I&#8217;ll post about the &#8220;why&#8221;s of it later, but I&#8217;m sure you can guess those.</p>

<p>Matthew was the only person to send me an email which instantly disqualifies him from the &#8220;no one special&#8221; category forever. He has gone out of his way to track down my email and tell me what he thought. Nobody else did. So I wrote him a reply effectively thanking him, and discussing a couple of things. A 1500-word reply. You can find <a href='http://ryanbigg.com/transcripts/matthew-joiner.html'>the transcript from this email here</a>. He mentioned my email was nowhere on the site, but now it is in the sidebar. This is the most direct-line of contact you can have with me just short of my mobile number.</p>

<p>This is also the kind of back-and-forth I want to have with you all. I want you to ask me questions about Rails 3, and in return I get something from you automatically, which is the feeling of satisfaction of being noticed. Then if I help you, further satisfaction that I&#8217;ve improved your life somehow.</p>

<p>Finally, when a lot of you start asking questions, then I have more material to write down for a book I&#8217;m thinking of writing. Yup, you heard it here: <strong>I'm going to take on writing a book</strong>. This is why I want you all working on Rails and the community, because I simply will not have the time to sit in the IRC channel or on Stack Overflow to help you out anymore. Somebody else needs to step up and &#8220;be me&#8221; temporarily if I am to complete this book by the end of the year. I want <strong>your feedback</strong> on this! So contact me on <a href='http://twitter.com/ryanbigg'>twitter</a> or <a href='mailto: radarlistener@gmail.com'>e-mail me</a> with ideas of what you think should go in a book about Rails.</p>

<p>So let me finish on a positive note. Since that post last weekend, over one hundred Rails tickets have been marked off the list, be it them being marked as invalid and then all the way up to patches being submitted and a lot of people getting things done. That&#8217;s an amazing amount of effort and it is these types of people the community needs more of. If you want to nominate somebody for the <a href='http://rubyheroes.com'>Ruby Hero</a> award, do not nominate me (ok, you can if you want). Nominate the collective of people making the community a better place. I am not the only person doing this. I fear for that situation. I do not want to be the go-to guy for all of your issues as that is the community&#8217;s job. But, in order to build a knowledgeable community, those with the knowledge need to be out there spreading it, rather than sitting in their &#8220;ivory towers&#8221;.</p>

<p>Side-note: I&#8217;d like to think I know for a fact that this post won&#8217;t gain the level of recognition that the original did. That&#8217;s fine with me. If you could go about proving me wrong, please do: I enjoy being wrong.</p>

<p>All I ask is that I want you to help one person a day with Ruby or Rails. Be it a co-worker, a friend, or a complete stranger. Just go out there and <strong>do something</strong>. C&#8217;mon, you can do it. It&#8217;s an awesome feeling.</p>}]]></content>

   <title>has_and_belongs_to_many double insert</title>
   <link href="http://ryanbigg.com/2010/04/has_and_belongs_to_many-double-insert"/>
   <updated>2010-04-14T00:00:00+10:00</updated>
   <id>http://ryanbigg.com/2010/04/has_and_belongs_to_many-double-insert</id>
   <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This is a story about my work with GetUp, in particular the past week. It&#8217;s about a problem that I&#8217;ve been putting off help one of the guys (James) solve, it didn&#8217;t seem all that important to me. So last night I kind of promised that I&#8217;d sit down with him this morning and help him work out what it was. Hopefully it was something silly either of us did and it would only take us an hour.</p>

<p>You know how this story is going to end up already.</p>

<p>It didn&#8217;t take us an hour. It&#8217;s now 5pm and I&#8217;ve only <em>just</em> figured out what it was.</p>
<h3>Symptoms</h3>
<p>We have two models who&#8217;s names aren&#8217;t important so excuse me if I use the name <code>Person</code> and <code>Address</code> to represent them. They are nothing of the sort. In their purest form to replicate this issue, they are defined like this:</p>

<pre><code>class Address &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
  has_and_belongs_to_many :people
end

class Person &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
  has_and_belongs_to_many :addresses
  accepts_nested_attributes_for :addresses</code></pre>

<p>end</p>

<p>When we go to <code>create</code> a new <code>Person</code> record:</p>

<pre><code>Person.create(:addresses_attributes =&gt; { &quot;0&quot; =&gt; { :suburb =&gt; &quot;Camperdown&quot; } }) </code></pre>

<p>It inserts <strong>1</strong> <code>Person</code> record, <strong>1</strong> <code>Address</code> record but <strong>2</strong> join table records.</p>
<h3>So, wtf?</h3>
<p>We originally thought it was a bug in our application. How, in all realities, could Rails have a bug, right?</p>
<strong>Wrong!</strong>
<p>I should know <a href='http://ryanbigg.com/2010/04/want-it-give/'>how many bugs Rails <strong>could</strong> have</a>. I should have been more wary. I was not. And it bit me in the arse. So out of curiosity I googled the issue and saw that others came across it and then I tried checking out to <code>v2.3.4</code>, which <strong>worked!</strong>. So there was a regression between <code>v2.3.5</code> and <code>v2.3.4</code>. A simple <code>git bisect bad v2.3.5</code> with <code>git bisect good v2.3.4</code> put me on the way to finding out what this was. A couple of <code>bisect</code>s later, I found the offending commit was <code>6b2291f3</code>, by Eloy Duran.</p>
<h3>A "solution(?)"</h3>
<p>So I <a href='http://github.com/radar/anaf'>generated an application</a> to simply demonstrate that this was a 2.3.5 regression. As I say in the README, I suggest using 2-3-stable if this bothers you. Alternatively there&#8217;s always Rails 3, or simply specifying the <code>:uniq =&gt; true</code> option on your <code>has_and_belongs_to_many</code>.</p>

<p>That was a fun 7 hours.</p>

<p>As I found out this (the next) morning and <a href='http://ryanbigg.com/2010/04/has_and_belongs_to_many-double-insert/#comment-36741'>Tim Riley points out in the comments</a> the ticket for this bug is <a href='https://rails.lighthouseapp.com/projects/8994/tickets/3575-multiple-join-records-when-using-nested_attributes-in-habtm'>#3575</a> and the related commit is <code>146a7505</code> by Eloy Duran also. Freezing rails to <code>v2.3.5</code> and <code>git cherry-pick</code>ing this commit into this frozen version fixes it.</p>}]]></content>

   <title>When Rails 3 is Due</title>
   <link href="http://ryanbigg.com/2010/04/when-rails-3-is-due"/>
   <updated>2010-04-05T00:00:00+10:00</updated>
   <id>http://ryanbigg.com/2010/04/when-rails-3-is-due</id>
   <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As a person who hangs out in #rubyonrails on Freenode a little too much of his spare time, I eventually come across repeated questions. This is why I made <a href='http://github.com/radar/railsbot'>the channel bot</a> which runs on <a href='http://github.com/radar/summer'>Summer</a>.</p>

<p>One of the hardest frequently asked question is &#8220;When is Rails 3 due?&#8221;, the next being &#8220;When is Rails 2.3.6 due?&#8221;</p>

<p>To be honest I don&#8217;t know, and I&#8217;m pretty sure not even Rails Core knows precisely when it&#8217;s due. Sure, they&#8217;ll have some kind of idea of when they&#8217;d like it to be released but it&#8217;s a very similar idea to mine of wanting to be rich (i.e. right now). <strong>Ideas and realities are two entirely separate worlds</strong>.</p>
<a href='http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2010/4/1/rails-3-0-second-beta-release'>On the 1st of April, Rails 3.0.0beta2 was announced by DHH</a>
<p>So why so long between releases? Well, lets go time traveling.</p>

<p>We travel back, <strong>back</strong> through time and its murk. We land spot bang in the middle of March 28, 2006. It&#8217;s on this day that a slightly-younger version of DHH <a href='http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2006/03/28/rails-1-1-rjs-active-record-respond_to-integration-tests-and-500-other-things/'>announces Rails 1.1</a>. Oh look it has RJS. How young and foolish we all were. By we, I mean you guys of course, this was at least 3 months before I even begun getting into Rails. So Rails 1.1 was born into the world on March 28th, 2006. Right then. What about the next significant version?</p>

<p>The next version would be Rails 1.2, let&#8217;s jump forward to <a href='http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2006/11/23/rails-1-2-release-candidate-1'>the first Rails 1.2 Release Candidate</a> on November 23rd, 2006. This is a distance of ~20,735,982 seconds (or in more sensible terms: 7 months and 27 days) between a major release (1.1) and a the next major release&#8217;s (1.2) release candidate. Ok, so when was the next release candidate?</p>

<p>That would be <a href='http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2007/1/5/rails-1-2-release-candidate-2'>the second Rails 1.2 release candidate</a>. Somewhere between these two releases I joined the Rails fray. The distance between releases? ~3,715,200 (or in more sensible terms: 1 month and 13 days). They really didn&#8217;t waste much time getting this out the door, and with so many changes too! Next!</p>

<p>So with the release candidates out of the way <a href='http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2007/1/19/rails-1-2-rest-admiration-http-lovefest-and-utf-8-celebrations'>DHH announces Rails 1.2</a>. This was a mere 17 days (~1,468,800 seconds in the &#8220;old money&#8221;) between release candidate and major release. 17 days (not a pattern) later, <a href='http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2007/2/6/rails-1-2-2-sqlite3-gems-singular-resources'>Rails 1.2.2 is announced</a>. On Pi day in 2007, 36 days after Rails 1.2.2 is released, <a href='http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2007/3/14/rails-1-2-3-compatible-with-ruby-1-8-6-and-other-fixes'>Rails 1.2.3 is released</a>. Then nothing happens for a while.</p>

<p>During the 30th September, 2007 <a href='http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2007/9/30/rails-2-0-0-preview-release'>A Rails 2.0.0 Preview Release</a> is announced. Surely the 2.0 release has to be close, right?</p>

<p>Between the 2.0 release postings, on the 5th of October, 2007, 6 months and 19 days after Rails 1.2.3 is released, <a href='http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2007/10/5/rails-1-2-4-maintenance-release'>Rails 1.2.4 comes out</a>. Then a mere week later, <a href='http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2007/10/12/rails-1-2-5-maintenance-release'>Rails 1.2.5 is announced and released</a>. Rails 2 work continued through these releases, as indicated by a <a href='http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2007/11/9/rails-2-0-release-candidate-1'>Rails 2 release candidate announcement</a> in the midst of November 2007. <a href='http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2007/11/24/ruby-on-rails-1-2-6-security-and-maintenance-release'>Rails 1.2.6</a> was announced 1 month and 12 days after Rails 1.2.5 was. This was to be the final version 1 release before Rails 2.</p>

<p>On December 7th, 2007, <a href='http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2007/12/7/rails-2-0-it-s-done'>Rails 2.0 was released</a> much to the joy of the Rails world. 10 days later <a href='http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2007/12/17/rails-2-0-2-some-new-defaults-and-a-few-fixes'>Rails 2.0.2</a> comes out with &#8220;some new defaults and a few fixes&#8221;. Then nothing happens for a while, again.</p>

<p>Then <a href='http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2008/6/1/rails-2-1-time-zones-dirty-caching-gem-dependencies-caching-etc'>Rails 2.1 came out</a>, on the 1st of June, 2008, 5 months and 23 days later.</p>

<p>Some more patch releases were made after the Rails 2.1 release. The 3rd of September is when <a href='http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2008/9/3/rails-2-0-4-maintenance-release'>Rails 2.0.4, the first patch release is announced</a>, 3 months and 2 days later. On the 19th October, 2008, another patch release <a href='http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2008/10/19/rails-2-0-5-redirect_to-and-offset-limit-sanitizing'>Rails 2.0.5</a> is released. This is 1 month and 16 days since the previous patch release.</p>
<a href='http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2008/9/5/rails-2-1-1-lots-of-bug-fixes'>Rails 2.1.1</a>
<p>It is important to note that it is around this point in time that <a href='http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2008/12/23/merb-gets-merged-into-rails-3'>the Merb + Rails merger is announced</a> on the 23rd December, 2008. This merge would grow into what we will soon know as Rails 3.</p>

<p>The next minor release after that was the <a href='http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2009/3/16/rails-2-3-templates-engines-rack-metal-much-more'>Rails 2.3 announcement</a>, 3 months and 24 days later on the 16th March, 2009, the first release of 2009. The next announced release occurred on the 20th July, 2009: <a href='http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2009/7/20/rails-2-3-3-touching-faster-json-bug-fixes'>Rails 2.3.3</a>. Some security fixes are announced, making <a href='http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2009/9/4/ruby-on-rails-2-3-4'>Rails 2.3.4</a> a reality 1 month and 15 days after the Rails 2.3.3 announcement.</p>

<p>Then we get to the most recent stable version of Rails: <a href='http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2009/11/30/ruby-on-rails-2-3-5-released'>Rails 2.3.5</a>. This was released a total of 2 months and 26 days after Rails 2.3.4.</p>

<p>Now most recently, the Rails 3 betas. The first was announced on the 5th Feburary 2010, 2 months and 5 days after Rails 2.3.5 was released, which doesn&#8217;t mean much. What&#8217;s a more relevant statistic would be that it was released 1 year, 1 month and 14 days after the Rails + Merb merge was announced. The beta was a very large and sweeping change of just about everything in Rails, afterall, this is a major release. There is going to be some major differences.</p>
<a href='http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2010/4/1/rails-3-0-second-beta-release'>Rails 3 beta 2</a>
<p>13 days after this, <a href='http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2010/4/13/rails-3-0-third-beta-release'>Rails 3 beta 3</a> is released and <a href='http://twitter.com/dhh/status/12120667185'>DHH says "we're getting close to home now!"</a>.</p>

<p>Once you know the release candidate goes out you&#8217;ll know there&#8217;ll be a huge hubbub of how momentous the ocassion is. I say everyone deserves a &#8220;huge round of applause&#8221; or whatever the internet equivalent is. The amount of work put in Rails 3 over the last year and a bit is tremendous. Then people can finally start (or continue, in some cases) migrating their plugins and gems over to Rails. Personally, I look forward to the day where I can begin a new Rails application using compatible versions of Cucumber and RSpec and the latest and greatest Rails 3 code.</p>

<p>This post is not intended to give a solid or even a vague guess at what the Rails 3 release date is going to be. If you want my personal opinion it&#8217;s going to be another 2 to 4 weeks (from April 5th, so April 15th-May 5th) before a release candidate. Pure, utter, guesswork based on observation. The regression tickets themselves do not seem overly complex and if they are the only thing in the way of a release candidate then I cannot see there being any major delay.</p>

   <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>So <a href='http://ryanbigg.com/2010/03/staying-in-scotland/'>I posted earlier</a> that I got offered a job in Scotland and was staying for a couple of weeks. (Un?)fortunately this is not the case. As of this writing I&#8217;m sitting very close to Changi Airport&#8217;s C23 in the &#8220;Laptop Access&#8221; area they have here getting my internet fix after a 12-and-a-half hour flight. Sitting in a middle seat. Scotland is a fantastic country and one day I may go back to visit it but for now my home is Sydney, closely followed by Brisbane. If something comes up that is irresistible then perhaps I will move elsewhere, but there are still plenty of opportunities in Australia for me and moving is such a ginormous pain in the ass. If I did move out of the country it&#8217;s more than likely I would have to sell everything I own and start afresh, a prospect I do not look forward to. I simply have too much crap, and I&#8217;m only 22.</p>

<p>So in summary: Staying in Sydney, not Scotland. Catch up with you all when I get the chance :)</p>}]]></content>

   <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This past week I <strong>a</strong>ttended the Scottish Ruby Conference and for the week <strong>pri</strong>or I was experiencing the joy that is Scot<strong>l</strong>and. I have made a decision to stay on a couple o<strong>f</strong> weeks and I ap<strong>o</strong>l<strong>o</strong>gise for those who I haven&#8217;t yet discussed this with.</p>

<p>Since the conference, I have been discussions with one of the local companies who wish to hire me to teach Ruby after my contract with GetUp has expired. I&#8217;m going to their offices in Edinburgh today for a meeting to discuss this. I think they&#8217;re fantastic people and it would be almost as much joy to work with them as it has been to work with GetUp and I would name them if it wasn&#8217;t for a damn NDA. GetUp&#8217;s going to be exceptionally hard to beat.</p>

<p>I may return to Australia to collect some things and put my affairs in order eventually, but Scotland just feels like the right place to be at the moment. It&#8217;s much closer to a larger number of countries than Australia with greater opportunities in the Ruby &amp; Rails sectors and I love everything here.</p>

<p>Later on today I will contact GetUp and let them know that I&#8217;m still willing to do work for them, albeit remotely, and I hope they will understand.</p>

<p>More on this <strong>l</strong>ater. <strong>S</strong>ee you then!</p>}]]></content>

   <updated>2010-03-07T00:00:00+10:00</updated>
   <id>http://ryanbigg.com/2010/03/starsigns-dreams</id>
   <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Now I know that you guys expect this to be like&#8230; pure technological content since I&#8217;m a technological kind of guy, but sometimes I do break the rules. This is one of those more of a &#8220;blog&#8221; and less of a &#8220;tutorial&#8221; or &#8220;code&#8221; post. Sorry. Just something strange has been going on. Oh, and it contains profanity. Sorry.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m not one who believes in fortune-telling, I think it&#8217;s a complete and utter scam. These people will tell you precisely what you want to hear so they and their brethren can get precisely what they want: your money. They tell you all these good things and to pay attention to your horoscopes and star signs and so on and so forth, so you&#8217;ll go out and buy all these books about it and effectively dedicate your entire life to knowing about what&#8217;s going to happen in your future.</p>

<p>Fuck you.</p>

<p>No, really. Do you think that you&#8217;re such <a href='http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0137523/quotes'>"a beautiful or unique snowflake"</a> that the stars, balls of burning Helium, Hydrogen and whatever the fuck else are actually representing your fate? That they are able to correctly predict what will happen to you in terms of life (love and not), money and well-being? Jesus H. Christ you people are fucked in the head. You are not <a href='http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0137523/quotes'>"a beautiful or unique snowflake"</a>. Your fate is entirely dependent on <strong>your actions</strong>. If you want something positive to happen: work the fuck towards it.</p>

<p>Do not get me started on Numerology, either.</p>

<p>My (read: your) God.</p>

<p>Now that I&#8217;ve got that whole little blurb out of the way I can go on telling a story of two exceptionally strange coincidences that have happened within the past week. Yes, I view them as &#8220;coincidences&#8221;, not as &#8220;messages from the stars&#8221; or whatever you loonies want to call them. Although occasionally I feel that <em>something</em> is causing these to happen but then I have a nice hard-dose of a little thing us sane-folk like to call &#8220;Reality&#8221; and I&#8217;m right as rain.</p>

<p>Coincidence #1.</p>

<p>A girl at work asked me if my Paypal account had any money in it, I thought it didn&#8217;t but I checked anyway. There was some in there and she asked if I could use $1 for it to test some of the site&#8217;s donation functionality as it was misbehaving. I did, and it was. Then I thought that the money would be best out of the hands of Paypal and better in the hands of my bank so I &#8220;wrote&#8221; a mental note to transfer it when I got home. I didn&#8217;t.</p>

<p>That night I dreamed of a person or people putting money into my Paypal account. I quite often dream of things related to the previous day, almost like it&#8217;s a consequence of them being committed to my long term memory or something. So in the dream as I receive the money and go to transfer it, naturally I wake up. I always wake up from dreams when it gets to the good part.</p>

<p>So I get out of bed and onto my computer and as soon as I open up IRC I receive a IRC private message from Zarathu who says that he appreciates all my help that I give him and others and would like to show his respect in monetary format. He sends me $100.</p>

<p>Go figure.</p>

<p>Coincidence #2.</p>

<p>I have flu-like symptoms and to help me sleep through them I&#8217;m taking Codral day &amp; night tablets. When I take the night tablets I have really, really vivid and sometimes whack(er than usual) dreams. Last night&#8217;s major consisted of myself and an unknown person really agreeing on something, we were having a discussion about something but there were no details. But we shared a common idea.</p>

<p>Tonight Marcelo &amp; his girlfriend cooked dinner for us all and Marcelo&#8217;s mother came over. We talk about what I do and Marcelo&#8217;s girlfriend asks if I do iPhone development. I say that I tried to get into it but I needed an app idea in order to learn the language. She says she has an idea but she won&#8217;t tell me it because she fears I will steal it. There&#8217;s this one application I&#8217;ve been looking for (and I won&#8217;t say it because <strong>YOU</strong> will steal it :)) since the iPhone came out and I ask &#8220;Is it something to do with &#8230;?&#8221;</p>

<p>Silence.</p>

<p>&#8220;How&#8217;d you do that?&#8221;, she asks.<br /> &#8220;Do what?&#8221;<br /> &#8220;Read my mind.&#8221;</p>

<p>We spend the next hour talking about how awesome this idea is.</p>

<p>So, I still view these as coincidences, but for something like this to happen twice in a week is kind of freaky.</p>}]]></content>

   <title>Testing Facebook</title>
   <link href="http://ryanbigg.com/2010/03/testing-facebook"/>
   <updated>2010-03-02T00:00:00+10:00</updated>
   <id>http://ryanbigg.com/2010/03/testing-facebook</id>
   <content type="html"><![CDATA[<strong>I would strongly, strongly, strongly encourage people to now use <a href='http://github.com/intridea/omniauth'>OmniAuth</a> for all their Facebook needs.</strong>
<p>We&#8217;re currently adding Facebook integration to an existing application that uses Authlogic. That means adding a button that any user can press on the login form that then takes them to Facebook, signs them in and then lets them log into our site. For this purpose and the time being &#8220;Facebook integration&#8221; means only that: letting the user login with their Facebook details. For the Facebook side of things we&#8217;re using <a href='http://github.com/mmagino/facebooker'>Facebooker</a> which is not the well-documented library we all would hope it is. Oh, and you <strong>cannot</strong> use it as a gem with Rails.</p>

<p>Also along with Facebooker we also use the <a href='http://github.com/kalasjocke/authlogic_facebook_connect'>Authlogic Facebook Connect</a> plugin to provide us with a button we use on our login form. It also provides us with a file called <em>xd\receiver.html</em> in our <em>public</em> folder which&#8217;s use <a href='http://wiki.developers.facebook.com/index.php/How_Connect_Authentication_Works'>is documented here</a>.</p>

<p>We created our <em>application.html.erb</em> using these key elements, as specified in the Authlogic Facebook Connect README:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;html&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
    &lt;%= javascript_include_tag :defaults %&gt;
    &lt;%= fb_connect_javascript_tag %&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;%= fb_connect_javascript_tag %&gt;
    &lt;%= init_fb_connect &quot;XFBML&quot; %&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</code></pre>

<p>Our login page is nothing out of the ordinary save for this tag placed where we want the button to connect to Facebook:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;%= authlogic_facebook_login_button :length =&gt; &quot;long&quot; %&gt;</code></pre>

<p>As stated in the <a href='http://wiki.developers.facebook.com/index.php/How_Connect_Authentication_Works'>Canonical Documentation</a> because we&#8217;ve generated the button the Javascript included into the layout will be executed when the user visits the page. This Javascript then calls the <code>FB.init(&quot;YOUR_API_KEY_HERE&quot;, &quot;xd_receiver.htm&quot;);</code> which does some Facebook/Javascript magic I am still yet to comprehend. This voodoo eventually renders a button that your user can click. When your user clicks this button it opens a popup window that asks the user to log into Facebook if they aren&#8217;t already, otherwise this will do a &#8220;seamless&#8221; login. We&#8217;ll go with the first option here and assume the user hasn&#8217;t logged in. But by the time you&#8217;ve read this, they have logged into Facebook and now the Javascript continues to execute, retrieving values from the popup window and stores them as cookies. After this is all &#8220;said and done&#8221; your form will be submitted and your app will carry on its merry way.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s the beginning of our Authlogic-juiced User model:</p>

<pre><code>class User &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
  acts_as_authentic do |c|
    c.session_class = UserSession

    c.login_field = :email
    c.validate_login_field = false
    c.validate_email_field = false
    c.validate_password_field = false

    c.ignore_blank_passwords = false
  end

  # Validations for email based accounts
  with_options :unless =&gt; :facebook_uid do |u|
    u.validates_presence_of :email, :message =&gt; :missing_email

    u.validates_presence_of :password, :on =&gt; :update, :if =&gt; :require_password?, :message =&gt; &quot;^You must enter a password.&quot;
  end

  with_options :unless =&gt; Proc.new {|u| u.email.blank? } do |u|
    u.validates_format_of :email, :with =&gt; Authlogic::Regex.email, :message =&gt; &quot;^The email given looks invalid, please check for typos.&quot;
    u.validates_uniqueness_of :email, :message =&gt; :email_in_use
    u.validates_confirmation_of :email, :message =&gt; &quot;^The emails given did not match.&quot;
  end
end</code></pre>

<p>As you can see here if <code>facebook_uid</code> is present we are not validating the presence of <code>email</code> or <code>password</code> for obvious reasons.</p>

<p>When your form is submitted it&#8217;ll go a <code>create</code> action in a controller (we called ours <code>UserSessionsController</code>) and looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>class UserSessionsController &lt; ApplicationController
  before_filter :check_fb, :only =&gt; :create
  #...
  def create
    @user_session = UserSession.new(params[:user_session])

    if @user_session.save &amp;&amp; !@user_session.user.suspended?
      unless @user_session.user.facebook_uid.nil?
        @user_session.user.active = true
        @user_session.user.save
      end

      flash[:notice] = t(:msg_welcome)
      if @user_session.user.login_count &gt; 1 &amp;&amp; @user_session.user.last_login_at?
        flash[:notice] &lt;&lt; &quot; &quot; &lt;&lt; t(:msg_last_login, @user_session.user.last_login_at.to_s(:mmddhhss))
      end
      redirect_back_or_default root_url
    else
      #...
    end
  end
  #...
  private

    def check_fb
      if params[:user_session].nil?
        ensure_authenticated_to_facebook
      end
    end
end</code></pre>

<p>We have specific code here to activate a user if they log in through Facebook; we assume that if a person is logging in through Facebook that they are not an automated robot (as opposed to a manual one?) and they do not need a confirmation email sent. What&#8217;s most exciting about this code however is <em>not</em> the create action, but the <code>before_filter</code> we run&#8230; erm, before&#8230; it.</p>

<p>As you can see, the <code>before_filter</code> calls <code>ensure_authenticated_to_facebook</code> which is a method from Facebooker, traditionally used itself as a <code>before_filter</code> but because we have the ability to log in with an email &amp; password OR a facebook login, is called conditionally. That method looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>def ensure_authenticated_to_facebook
  set_facebook_session || create_new_facebook_session_and_redirect!
end</code></pre>

<p>This attempts the <code>set_facebook_session</code> method first:</p>

<pre><code>def set_facebook_session
  # first, see if we already have a session
  session_set = session_already_secured?
  # if not, see if we can load it from the environment
  unless session_set
    session_set = create_facebook_session
    session[:facebook_session] = @facebook_session if session_set
  end
  if session_set
    capture_facebook_friends_if_available! 
    Session.current = facebook_session
  end
  return session_set
end</code></pre>

<p>We do not have a current session so it&#8217;ll go and call <code>create_facebook_session</code>:</p>

<pre><code>def create_facebook_session
  secure_with_facebook_params! || secure_with_cookies! || secure_with_token!
end</code></pre>

<p>So this uses three methods: <code>secure_with_facebook_params!</code>, <code>secure_with_cookies!</code> or <code>secure_with_token</code>. Remember what I said earlier about what happens when the user presses the button? No? Here&#8217;s a refresher: it sets cookies. Not the edible kind, sadly. So the method that&#8217;ll be used here is <code>secure_with_cookies!</code>.</p>

<p>I feel now is a good time to show you the test we wrote.</p>

<pre><code>describe UserSessionsController do
  describe &quot;create&quot; do
    describe &quot;facebook user&quot; do
      it &quot;creates account based on facebook details&quot; do
        Facebooker.use_curl = false 
        FakeWeb.allow_net_connect = false
        FakeWeb.register_uri(:post, &quot;http://api.facebook.com/restserver.php&quot;, :body =&gt; Rails.root + &quot;spec/fixtures/get_users_info.xml&quot;)
  
        setup_fb_connect_cookies

        post :create

        response.should redirect_to(root_url)
        @assigned_user = assigns[:user_session].user
        @assigned_user.new_record?.should be_false
        @assigned_user.active.should be_true
      end
    end
  end
end</code></pre>

<p>The <code>Facebooker.use_curl = false</code> is only neccesary if you have the <em>curb</em> gem installed. Hat-tip to <a href='http://ryanbigg.com/2010/03/testing-facebook/comment-page-1/#comment-34739'>Balvig</a> in the comments!</p>

<p>We first disable internet connections using FakeWeb. We do this so we can stub out the response to Facebooker&#8217;s internal call to <code>getUsersInfo</code> to Facebook and always return a valid user object. The fake XML <a href='http://gist.github.com/319392#file_get_users_info.xml'> can be viewed in this gist.</a></p>

<p>After Fakeweb has done its thing we call the <code>setup_fb_connect_cookies</code> method which does exactly what it says on the box, it lives in the <em>spec/support/facebook_helpers.rb</em> file:</p>

<pre><code>def setup_fb_connect_cookies
  cookie_hash_for_auth.each {|k,v| request.cookies[ENV[&#39;FACEBOOK_API_KEY&#39;]+k] = CGI::Cookie.new(ENV[&#39;FACEBOOK_API_KEY&#39;]+k,v).first}
end

def cookie_hash_for_auth
  hash = {&quot;_ss&quot; =&gt; &quot;not_used&quot;, &quot;_session_key&quot;=&gt; &quot;whatever&quot;, &quot;_user&quot;=&gt;&quot;77777&quot;, &quot;_expires&quot;=&gt;&quot;#{1.day.from_now.to_i}&quot;}
  raw_string = hash.map{ |k,v| [k.gsub(/^_/, &#39;&#39;), v].join(&#39;=&#39;) }.sort.join
  actual_sig = Digest::MD5.hexdigest([raw_string, Facebooker::Session.secret_key].join)
  hash.merge(&quot;&quot; =&gt; actual_sig)
end</code></pre>

<p>Why such complicated code? Well, this provides the cookies that Facebooker needs in order to log in. The final three lines in the <code>cookie_hash_for_auth</code> method is all about setting up a &#8220;signature&#8221; which Facebook parses in the parameters to ensure that they haven&#8217;t been tampered with. The generation of this was ripped straight from the guts of Facebooker which uses (almost) the same code to generate an MD5 to verify the signature against.</p>

<p>In short: We now have cookies that our <code>post :create</code> is going to use. So, when this is triggered <code>secure_with_cookies!</code> does its thing:</p>

<pre><code>def secure_with_cookies!
    parsed = {}

    fb_cookie_names.each { |key| parsed[key[fb_cookie_prefix.size,key.size]] = cookies[key] }

    #returning gracefully if the cookies aren&#39;t set or have expired
    return unless parsed[&#39;session_key&#39;] &amp;&amp; parsed[&#39;user&#39;] &amp;&amp; parsed[&#39;expires&#39;] &amp;&amp; parsed[&#39;ss&#39;] 
    return unless (Time.at(parsed[&#39;expires&#39;].to_s.to_f) &gt; Time.now) || (parsed[&#39;expires&#39;] == &quot;0&quot;)      
    #if we have the unexpired cookies, we&#39;ll throw an exception if the sig doesn&#39;t verify
    verify_signature(parsed,cookies[Facebooker.api_key], true)

    @facebook_session = new_facebook_session
    @facebook_session.secure_with!(parsed[&#39;session_key&#39;],parsed[&#39;user&#39;],parsed[&#39;expires&#39;],parsed[&#39;ss&#39;])
    @facebook_session
end</code></pre>

<p>This has now generated a value for <code>session[:facebook_session]</code>, a <code>Facebooker::Session</code> object. Great. The <code>@user_session</code> in our controller has a user method that returns a valid user and we ensure it&#8217;s that way in the remainder of the controller test. Great, so that part works. Now about how <em>doing</em> something with the logged in user?</p>

<p>Well for that purpose, <a href='http://blog.eizesus.com/2010/02/facebooker-tips-1-session-expiry-cucumber-and-env-6-2-2010/'>Elad Meidar wrote a blog post covering how to do it in Cucumber</a>. This consists of setting up your facebooker.yml to having a <code>cucumber</code> key share the configuration of the <code>development</code> key and a couple of steps:</p>

<pre><code>Given /^I am logged in as a Facebook user$/ do

  # Initializer facebooker session
  @integration_session = open_session

  @current_user = User.create! :facebook_id =&gt; 1

  # User#facebook_user returns a Facebook::User instance, i decided to mock the session in here since i am not
  # sure what the behavior might be if it will be in the actual model.
  @current_user.facebook_user.session = Facebooker::MockSession.create(ENV[&#39;FACEBOOK_API_KEY&#39;], ENV[&#39;FACEBOOK_SECRET_KEY&#39;])
  @current_user.facebook_user.friends = [ Facebooker::User.new(:id =&gt; 2, :name =&gt; &#39;Bob&#39;),
    Facebooker::User.new(:id =&gt; 3, :name =&gt; &#39;Sam&#39;)]
  @integration_session.default_request_params.merge!( :fb_sig_user =&gt; @current_user.facebook_id, :fb_sig_friends =&gt; @current_user.facebook_user.friends.map(&amp;:id).join(&#39;,&#39;) )
end</code></pre>

<p>This code sets the parameters on the next request and Facebooker accepts these and uses them to create a new <code>Facebooker::Session</code> object, which it stores in <code>session[:facebook_session]</code>.</p>

<p>The <code>open_session</code> method comes from Facebooker by placing this line in <em>features/support/app.rb</em>:</p>

<pre><code>require &#39;facebooker/rails/cucumber&#39;</code></pre>

<p>The <code>facebook_user</code> method on our <code>User</code> object comes from defining it on the <code>User</code> model:</p>
<script src='http://gist.github.com/296758.js?file=user.rb' />
<p>Now with the steps and correct requires in place, we have our feature:</p>

<pre><code>Feature: Facebook
  In order to use the site as a facebook user
  As a user
  I want to have already logged in with Facebook and be roaming the wide brown lands

  Scenario: logging into facebook
    Given I am logged in as a Facebook user
  	And I am on the homepage
    Then I should be on the homepage</code></pre>

<p>This is just a silly example that ensures that the user is not redirected back to the login page if they are logged in as a Facebook user. I hope you write better features than this. This feature will fail for the time being because our <code>current_user</code> method only queries <code>current_user_session</code>, so we&#8217;ll modify it to be this instead:</p>

<pre><code>def current_user
  @current_user ||= (current_user_session &amp;&amp; current_user_session.record)
  @current_user ||= User.find_by_facebook_uid(session[:facebook_session].user.uid)
end</code></pre>

<p>Now we can use <code>current_user</code> to reference current Facebook users too, meaning our feature will now pass.</p>

<p>With a controller spec and feature passing, that&#8217;s lunch!</p>
<h3>For After Lunch</h3>
<p>So how was lunch? I hope it was good. Since this is only a one-way kind of communication I can&#8217;t accurately respond to whatever you&#8217;re going to say. Sorry!</p>

<p>Right then! So our application is tested well enough that we know that we can log in using faked-out Facebook cookies, but does the actual real-world side of things work? Does clicking the button actually prompt the user to log into Facebook if they haven&#8217;t already or just go through that whole section transparently and present them with an already logged in screen?</p>

<p>Chances are this is a big, gigantic, fat</p>
<h3>No.</h3>
<p>You&#8217;ll more-than-likely run across an &#8220;Invalid parameter&#8221; issue as we had when we tried to use our application. The error code for this is 100.</p>

<p>So what&#8217;s up?</p>

<p>Well, as it turns out, when you try to go to the login page for an application that hasn&#8217;t yet been activated it just warns you that it hasn&#8217;t been activated. I&#8217;m not quite clear on how Facebooker works in this particular section, but it is my understanding that the login page is supposed to take you to the application page. Let me explain in step-by-step kind of way. &#8220;application&#8217;s page&#8221; means your site in this scenario. You&#8217;ve set this up by specifying the &#8220;Connect URL&#8221; in the &#8220;Connect&#8221; section of your Application Settings page to be the root-level of your site. So this is how Facebooker does its thing:</p>
<pre class='markdown-html-error' style='border: solid 3px red; background-color: pink'>REXML could not parse this XML/HTML: 
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Facebooker grabs an auth_token using the `facebook.Auth.createToken` API method. This returns something like `72a910e1f24eb6034549d23cd2245f28`&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; This `auth_token` is then passed to `http://facebook.com/login.php` as a parameter, which is rendered in whichever fashion you wish. For all intents and purposes, our application renders it in another browser window.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The login.php page detects if you are logged out or in and does either:
  &lt;li&gt; If you&apos;re logged out of Facebook, prompts for an email and password. If you &quot;get this right&quot;, Facebook sets up some cookies, links that `auth_token` to your Facebook user, and redirects you to the application.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt; If you&apos;re logged in to Facebook, Facebook sets up some cookies, links that `auth_token` to your Facebook user, and redirects you to the application.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The cookies are then used to call `facebook.Auth.getSession` which, because you&apos;re now most-definitely logged into Facebook, will return a session object. Something that looks like:

&lt;pre&gt;
2.5KVyRHmZWBbOun8ZwDwQxg__.3600.1243290000-608966587\n  608966587\n  1268190000
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Facebooker creates a `Facebooker::Session` object based on this return value which it stores in your application as `session[:facebook_session]`&lt;/li&gt;

What could possibly go wrong is that if you have your application in &quot;Sandbox Mode&quot; (under &quot;Advanced&quot; in &quot;Application Settings&quot;), when you go to the login page you&apos;ll be shown the &quot;This application is under construction&quot; and therefore Facebook will not link your user account with the `auth_token` so when `facebook.Auth.getSession` tries to do what its name implies: it&apos;ll fail with &quot;Invalid Parameter&quot;. Just be careful about that! It had us caught up for a day and bit, we didn&apos;t know about that option.

 I hope you found this as informative as I found it interesting to investigate.</pre>}]]></content>

   <title>Congratulations</title>
   <link href="http://ryanbigg.com/2010/02/congratulations"/>
   <updated>2010-02-13T00:00:00+10:00</updated>
   <id>http://ryanbigg.com/2010/02/congratulations</id>
   <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Congratulations! Youve worked so amazingly hard over the last seven-and-a-half months on this project. You met all the clients demands as they came in. You completed the project on-time and under the $30,000 budget by $2,000. The client is pleased about that. You can tell by the dollar signs in his eyes. The client is also pleased that theyre able to put the website out to the world to grow and conquer it, it already has a couple of users from the beta invites you sent out earlier in the week. You still keep in touch with the client on an almost-daily basis. Hes saying the sites doing great.</p>

<p>But.</p>

<p>Theres this one user whos reporting an issue with a feature you worked on 3 months ago. The client has set up his personal email address to receive the bug reports. You receive them when he gets around to sending them. A page is showing Were sorry but something went wrong.</p>

<p>Uh oh.</p>

<p>You log into the website and check for yourself. Sure enough that page is throwing a 500. But why? This feature was completed 3 months ago and worked fine then, didnt it? You try it on your local machine and you see that perhaps its something simple. Perhaps a variable incorrectly spelled in the controller. Or perhaps not. Perhaps it takes you longer than a couple of seconds to identify the issue. Perhaps it takes you an hour, a day.</p>

<p>A week.</p>

<p>So how did this error come to be? You did write tests, didnt you?</p>

<p>Oh I see.</p>

<p>Because of the impending deadline you were pressured for time and couldnt be bothered learning any of the testing frameworks. You want to. So many people talk about it in such a positive attitude&#8230; it&#8217;s just you don&#8217;t have the time. When you bring the point up, your boss says The clients not paying you to write tests, hes paying you to write features Even though your Rails knowledge has increased during the life of this project three to four times the size of what it previously was, you still dont know shit about testing. Maybes the time to start to learn you think. Ah, but The Boss doesnt want you spending time not producing features. Tests are a waste of the clients money he claims. You sigh. Ill do the next project better. Ill get him to see the light. I&#8217;ll really push for testing&#8230;, you say in your head. Ok, so you didnt write tests.</p>

<p>So here&#8217;s the facts:</p>

<ul>
<li>There&#8217;s a bug.</li>

<li>You worked on it in the past.</li>

<li>You must fix it. Now.</li>
</ul>

<p>So how do you go about debugging this bug to ensure that it doesn&#8217;t happen again? Well, you fix it and you know that it won&#8217;t happen again because you fixed it, right? You&#8217;ll leave a decent comment (actually, you&#8217;ll think about leaving a decent comment) after it&#8217;s fixed, that way nobody will repeat your mistake. Right?</p>

<p>Wrong.</p>

<p>Alright, so you know it&#8217;s sometime in the past. You can view the list of branches and maybe one will trigger your memory, surely you have branches with memorable names?</p>

<p>&#8220;Two Strikes&#8221; you say? Shame about that. Oh yeah, branching in SVN is a pain in the ass. I agree. If only you could convince your boss to use Git too. Git&#8217;s branching is so much nicer. Maybe you&#8217;ll get him to &#8220;see the light&#8221; about that on the next project too. So all the changes are in the trunk, and going back through them is, of course, going to take a lot of time. Best of luck with that.</p>

<p>So let&#8217;s assume that you chance across it. You remember the revision and fix the bug. Gone. Dead. Destroyed. Defeated. Sent to the depths of Hell along with one eighteenth of your sanity. That was quite a toughy. You did write a regression test to ensure that it wouldnt happen again, right?</p>

<p>Oh I see.</p>

<p>You commented on the Basecamp todo item saying that it was fixed. I guess it has a searchable name, right? Just in case it comes up again? Its called Something went wrong or &#8220;Page is broken&#8221;?</p>

<p>Uh oh.</p>

<p>So you go home, satisfied that you kicked the ass of a bug that had been on your mind for days. You win.</p>

<p>Congratulations.</p>

<p>The next day you wake up, grab your coffee/milk/orange juice and check your emails. Theres 3 from Facebook, a couple from a few mailing lists you subscribe to and fourteen from your client. These arent fourteen love letters. You see the first one was sent to you 20 minutes after you went to bed. If only you had stayed up later.</p>

<p>You read the first one. Its a bug report. So is the next one. And the one after that. And the one after that. And guess what? The one after that, too.</p>

<p>All fourteen emails your client sent to you overnight werent Thanks for all your fabulous work on the site they were the Why the fuck is this shit broken? kind of language. He paid good money for it he thinks. You are happy being paid whatever it is you earn. It hasnt been long that youve been doing this anyway and you have to start out somewhere. People make mistakes, right?</p>

<p>Congratulations.</p>

<p>You now have bug reports to deal with when you get into work this morning. 8 hours in a day, with each bug taking you 30 minutes to do. Easy, with time to spare. Pfft. Done by sundown, you think. You realise that one of the bug reports that got sent in was that bug that you fixed the other day. Another developer working on your project had a conflict with the file and accidentally put back the broken code instead of the working code. Ok. Thats fine. Youll fix that again. Maybe you never wrote that comment and you insert it now. Yeah, that&#8217;ll stop them re-introducing it.</p>

<p>You have a 2hr meeting with another client at the beginning of the day, leaving you with only 6 hours to fix those bugs by sundown. You spend an extra half-hour at lunch. Five-and-a-half-hours. But by lunch youd already killed four of them. You were a bit groggy this morning and you think that lunch will cure that feeling. Youll conquer the other ten this afternoon.</p>

<p>You dont.</p>

<p>You finish four, maybe five of them leaving eight, maybe nine bugs fixed. The client is not pleased. You have only done some of the work. ALL the bugs were critical. Your company is small, and you&#8217;re the only one with the knowledge of the project, plus, the other developers are busy on their own projects. The client expects&#8230; DEMANDS&#8230; a 7-day-a-week-24-hour-all-the-freakin-time response.</p>

<p>Because youre his bitch.</p>

<p>Alright. So your boss gives him a large apologetic email that you will try harder in the future to meet all of his demands because you dont want to lose this client. Hes invested $30,000 in this company already and with Version 2? of the site just around the corner hell probably invest a lot more.</p>

<p>So youre back to fixing those remaining bugs. During the night another three have come in. Your bug count is now eight. Eight hours in a day, eight bugs in the list. Done by sundown. You complete five during work hours and two when you get home, after dinner. Youre exhausted. They took you all day to debug. You email the client and say that youve only fixed seven of the eight bugs. He emails you back, naturally twenty minutes after youve gone to sleep saying that the eighth and final bug makes the site unusable. Your boss brings you in in the morning and says that your work isnt good enough. You baulk at this suggestion. You claim to have fixed thirteen of the fourteen bugs the client emailed you earlier in the week. You feel that you&#8217;ve put in some exceptionally hard work this week. Today youll have completed the fourteenth one, youre so confident about that. He naturally asks why there were fourteen bugs in the first place. You dont have an immediate answer, although you think of mentioning testing. He continues on his rant about that you should be testing the code each time you deploy it. Go through the site and make sure that its ok, you know, just click on the links and sure it&#8217;s working. The boss continues on his tirade for an hour. You try to counter his arguments but you view him as some sort of higher-being and due to your lack of experience you cant fault him. Hes the boss man after all. He got there somehow. He&#8217;s gotta be right about everything?</p>

<p>Your company has accrued all this technical debt that you didnt budget for. This carries on for a month longer and now the client has gone over his budget by $2,000. $2,000 he never wanted to spend. Instead of <em>saving</em> $2,000 he&#8217;s now spent an extra $2,000 out of his own personal account in order to get this going. Hes talking about leaving your company and moving to another one who could do a better job. This is probably the case. Your boss brings you in and tells you whats what with this project. The client is leaving. The next day he fires you.</p>

<p>Congratulations, Freebird. Youre out of a job and very, very nearly out of money. A couple of grand is all you have left. Time to begin that hunt again.</p>

<p>So how do you prevent something like this from happening?</p>

<p>You eventually get a new job working with a new company. You sit down with your new client and you do it right. You spec out their application&#8217;s stories using something like Pivotal Tracker. You&#8217;re taught to write tests religiously for every single story in Cucumber. There isnt a story without a test. This reduces technical debt in the long run. You wont have as many bugs like you did when you didnt test with the previous application. You will have bugs, though, but you wont be spending those long nights fixing them because you have tests covering it all. The tests will show you where something went wrong because more than likely, a broken part of the site also means a broken test. See a bug that&#8217;s not covered by a story or a test? That sometimes happens, but now you have this <em>wonderful</em> framework for really ensuring it doesn&#8217;t happen again: Regression testing. Write the test. It breaks. Fix the bug. It passes. If you and your team stick to the Green is Good policy, then you and they will NEVER EVER reintroduce this bug. In theory, anyway. People make mistakes.</p>

<p>So you start off on a simple story such as User login and you write a cucumber feature for it with two scenarios. One for logging in. One for logging out. Youve written all the steps for it but some of them are not implemented, others are just plain broken. Thats because you havent written any code for it yet. It may feel backwards at first. This is called Behaviour Driven Development. Youre going to be learning it, and youre going to do it right from now on. You&#8217;re going to be a BDD Zealot. You implement each step one at a time and eventually your feature is all green.</p>

<p>Why do you do this?</p>

<p>So future-you doesnt come back in 3 months, see that this feature is broken and begin working on a time machine to go back and kick your dumb ass.</p>

<p>Bonus points if youre using a Continuous Integration server to ensure that this feature and its eventual test brothers stay green. A broken build means a broken application and your singular goal if that build is ever broken is to make it very, very unbroken.</p>

<p>Congratulations.</p>

<p>You can now mark that story as Finished in Pivotal. Then you can deploy it to a staging server and mark it as Delivered. The client then can log in to Pivotal and see that the story is marked as Delivered and then log in to the staging server, test that feature and press that lovely holy-grail Accept button. You want to be seeing green stories in your Pivotal list. Green is the colour you want to be seeing everywhere.</p>

<p>Green is Good.</p>

<p>So the next feature comes along and involves some rather complex controller logic that returns a JSON hash. You can write this also in Cucumber, or you could write an RSpec Controller test. This is the kind of thing that&#8217;s really great for in-team discussions. You&#8217;ll suggest Way A of doing it, and maybe the other team people will agree or suggest Way B, and that lovely dynamic of throwing ideas back and forth really produces a better result. Either way, youll write the test first and then the code. Behaviour Driven Development. Then the test will pass. Then you can refactor the code if it&#8217;s not quite up to scratch and itll still pass. Sure it will feel slow at first, but thats because youre learning how to do it. Dont fight it. It will save you a lot of time in the future, where its most important. Focus rather on the long term gains rather than the short term.</p>

<p>Eventually after the next seven-and-a-half months youll have all these Pivotal Tracker stories all green in the Completed section and maybe one or two in the Backlog that the client wants done for next release. Youll run all the specs on your system. Theyre all green. Youll run all the features. Theyre all green. You deploy to the staging server for the last time for this release. The client loves it. You deploy it to production and send out the invites. Everyone loves it.</p>

<p>But.</p>

<p>Theres a bug. This time however youve installed something like Hoptoad so in your inbox youve got the error there, right when it happened. You are the support team for this application, NOT the client. After all, youre still working for a small company. It contains stacktrace and you can see where it went wrong immediately. You write a test/feature to ensure that this bug would never happen again. It fails because you havent fixed the bug. The error is the same one as in the Hoptoad email. You fix the bug.</p>

<p>Congratulations. Youve successfully regression tested a bug. This bug never happens again for the life of the project.</p>

<p>The client is happy. Your boss asks if he can have a chat with you. Youre doing an awesome job. The other guys were previously on a higher salary than you because you were perceived to be a junior. Not any more. You&#8217;ve come an amazingly long way. Now youre equal. The client wants more work done on his application. Hes flying your boss to his offices next week. Theyve specifically requested you to go along too, as you seem switched on. You meet up with the client and discuss the terms of the next iteration, a major one. This deal goes through and your company needs to grow. Massively. The application explodes, in the positive meaning. You run into scaling issues (of course). You bring on another ten guys over the next year just to work on this application. You and a couple of the other Originals teach them all you know about your application and the process youve helped develop. They then go on to teach the other twenty people you hire in the six months following.</p>

<p>Congratulations. Now youre doing it right.</p>}]]></content>

   <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>For a couple of weeks now I&#8217;ve been writing <a href='http://ryanbigg.com/guides/initialization.html'>a guide on how the initialization process in Rails 3 works</a>. As of writing, the guide and its accompanying &#8220;notes&#8221; totals over 10,000 words. I admit that this is currently nowhere near completion, but I am working on it and I need <strong>your help</strong>. I need people to go over it for me and point out anything that they don&#8217;t quite understand or I have stated incorrectly and <a href='http://github.com/radar/how-rails-works/issues'>file an issue on the repository for it.</a> Originally I was going to accept pull requests but they aren&#8217;t &#8220;public knowledge&#8221; and I don&#8217;t want two or more people submitting pull requests to fix the same chunk of code. With issues, people can see that &#8220;oh, there&#8217;s already a typo here.&#8221; and move on to finding more errors and punching more holes through it.</p>

<p>So yeah, if you guys could <a href='http://ryanbigg.com/guides/initialization.html'>read my guide</a> and <a href='http://github.com/radar/how-rails-works/issues'>file any issues you find with it</a>, that&#8217;d be swell!</p>}]]></content>

   <updated>2010-02-01T00:00:00+10:00</updated>
   <id>http://ryanbigg.com/2010/02/computer-woes</id>
   <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today I had to deal with two Windows-based computers&#8217; problems for Mark and Marlene. Here&#8217;s what happened.</p>
<h3>Mark</h3>
<p>Mark has a 4 year old Compaq Presario f500 which occasionally when you switch it on it&#8217;ll keep rebooting itself without showing anything on the screen. The fix for this was to turn it off, leave it off for a couple of seconds and then turn it back on. Then the problem went away until you turned it off and on again, in which it would resume. I couldn&#8217;t figure this one out. The other problem Mark had with his computer is that when he left it alone the screen would go strange. We figured out this was his screensaver, and changing away from the &#8220;Pictures Slideshow&#8221; option fixed it. I suspect there&#8217;s something in there that isn&#8217;t quite right.</p>
<h3>Marlene</h3>
<p>Marlene&#8217;s daughter has a recently bought no-name-brand case with a no-name-brand motherboard in it. Marlene had the computer at her house because she told me about the issue last night and I couldn&#8217;t fix it over the phone and her house is easier to get to than her daughter&#8217;s. The issue was that the computer wasn&#8217;t getting past the first POST screen, the one with the CPU &amp; Memory information. I opened up the case when I got to Marlene&#8217;s house and saw that the cable for the CPU fan had a tiny cable tie clip on it that was stopping the CPU fan from spinning. Apparently this stops the computer from getting past that point! I moved it out of the way and tucked it around some other cords to make sure it wouldn&#8217;t get in the way again, sealed the case and tested it, it worked and so I thought that was that.</p>

<p>Until 5:30 tonight.</p>

<p>Marlene phones me up. The computer&#8217;s making a beeping noise. I can hear it in the background, &#8220;BEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEP&#8221;, pause, rinse, repeat. One long beep. It wasn&#8217;t doing that earlier. So I trek as far north in Brisbane as I have ever gone to play around with this box. I <strong>needed</strong> to fix this problem as I felt it was something I did. I get there and sure enough it&#8217;s making the &#8220;BEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEP&#8221; noise. I take the side off the case and the cord for the CPU is where I put it and that fan&#8217;s spinning alright.</p>

<p>I looked it up on Wikipedia and it said that it could have been a memory issue, so I took that out. No change. I took out the graphics card. No change. I took out the sound card. No change. I unplugged the power and data cables to the harddrives and DVD drives. No change.</p>

   <title>Why Mocra Is Awesome</title>
   <link href="http://ryanbigg.com/2010/01/why-mocra-is-awesome"/>
   <updated>2010-01-21T00:00:00+10:00</updated>
   <id>http://ryanbigg.com/2010/01/why-mocra-is-awesome</id>
   <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Mocra is awesome because their employees are some of the brightest and most &#8220;switched on&#8221; people I know. They come up with fantastic ideas and execute them brilliantly. They even sometimes allow their employees to work on open source <strong>during work hours</strong>. Putting that much brainpower into a company that small is a genius idea. Yes, they&#8217;ve struggled. But what small business doesn&#8217;t? It&#8217;s still in its early phase and they&#8217;ve refined their process down to a tee and are really getting their stuff together. I fully support the company and will remain friends with them all. If you&#8217;re looking to hire a Rails company for your new/existing Rails application, <strong><em><a href='mailto:rails@mocra.com'>hire Mocra</a></em></strong>.</p>

<p>Now to being completely honest with everyone.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve decided that I want a change. As of today, I am no longer employed by them. I&#8217;m not sure how to phrase what went down. I got angry, and left. This had happened before. Later Nic called and asked me to come in to have a chat the next morning. <strong>This is entirely my fault.</strong> I wanted to leave for a while, to explore what else is out there. With freelancing, I got that power to travel and work with different people. I know the whole &#8220;grass is greener&#8221; cliche, and I&#8217;m aware of that. I need something different, perhaps to only focus on one project instead of multiple at a time? I&#8217;m not quite sure. Freelancing was fun, but it&#8217;s also very, very lonely. I&#8217;ve had a couple of leads but I think it&#8217;s too soon to be jumping into another job. I need to realise that, attitude wise, I need to change it. I&#8217;ve changed it since NetFox quite a lot with some of that due to a little book called &#8220;How to Win Friends and Influence People&#8221; by Dale Carnegie. The suggestion to read this book came from no other than Dr. Nic himself. I read it and realised there were some things in there that I wasn&#8217;t doing and that would not only improve my life, but the life of the people around me. It did exactly that.</p>

<p>One thing the book does not have a chapter for is anger. When we went to the Ski Trip at Thredbo I got angry with a waitress because I wasn&#8217;t served a steak. Everybody else&#8217;s order came out, and mine was simply lost in the process. They made a mistake, and I got angry for no real reason. The waitress apologised but the mistake was done! How <strong>dare</strong> she stuff up <strong>my</strong> order! She&#8217;s supposed to be a professional. I could put this down to the fact that I was tired, but that should not be used as an excuse. As long as I have the ability to breathe I should have the ability to be polite and analyse a situation before showing my emotional response. This is what I need to continue to refine. There&#8217;s no showing you how much I&#8217;ve improved since the school days, since Netfox, I can only state that I have.</p>

<p>And only yesterday did I lash out at Bo. I had just received an email for my car damage. I had scraped the side of it and destroyed the right mirror by reversing along side a pole at a shopping center. I was angry at myself then, and that level of anger I believe was acceptable for that situation. I made a mistake, and it was going to cost me money. The email said the repair and the service was going to cost $1,500! I tried to bottle it up and shrug it off, but it ate away at me inside. $1,500! GONE! For what? Shortly after I was writing a bash script to change the keymappings for a plugin Mocra uses called Telefrag. This plugin works with Teleport and allows me to type in QWERTY when Bo or Chendo is typing in Colemak or Dvorak respectively, dismissing the need to switch keyboard layouts with a shortcut. The script wasn&#8217;t working as I wanted it and Bo suggested something whilst I was trying something else, and I said something angrily at him. This is an unacceptable case of showing my anger, and therefore I failed, again. I was not angry with Bo and he&#8217;s not the one who cost me $1,500. It was me. Getting angry like that cost me my job and I fear could cost me future employment opportunities and eventually leave me in a worse state than where I am at now. I need to stop getting angry so easy and over such trivial things. I need to learn how to.</p>

<p>Mocra is awesome, I failed them and am now unemployed again due to my, and only my, actions. I will fix this, I promise you. This post needs to exist so that people can show it to me, remind me of it, snap me out of it. I will always remember how bad I felt writing it, but also how much of a relief it was to get it off my chest. Yeah, future employers may see this. At this specific point in time I am still human, and therefore still have emotions. This is me describing my journey of controlling them for self-betterment.</p>

<p>Thanks to those who have offered their support over the past 24 hours (friends &amp; family), you have all been brilliant and without such a group I would have probably done something drastic. If you guys ever need anything, I am always available for a chat, as you have been for me. I don&#8217;t care if it&#8217;s 4am. Call me if we need to talk. I&#8217;m there.</p>

<p>Seriously, <strong><em><a href='mailto:rails@mocra.com'>hire Mocra</a></em></strong>. They have been fantastic, and I know that they have, can and will succeed.</p>}]]></content>

   <title>Ruby 1.9.1 & Friends: 11 Months On</title>
   <link href="http://ryanbigg.com/2009/12/ruby-1-9-1-friends-11-months-on"/>
   <updated>2009-12-05T00:00:00+10:00</updated>
   <id>http://ryanbigg.com/2009/12/ruby-1-9-1-friends-11-months-on</id>
   <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I admit that the title would be cooler if this were &#8220;1 year on&#8221; but I couldn&#8217;t wait. Sorry.</p>

<p>Back in January I <a href='http://frozenplague.net/2009/01/ruby-191-rubygems-rails/'>wrote a post</a> about installing Ruby 1.9.1 on my Mac OS X box and the issues associated with it. The &#8220;end goal&#8221; was to get <a href='http://github.com/radar/rboard'>rboard</a> running on it under passenger. This was painful back in January! It&#8217;s so much easier now!</p>

<p>Unfortunately, there&#8217;s still <a href='http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1627582/ruby-1-9-1-p234-passenger-2-2-5-rails-2-3-stable-closed-stream-on-post-request'>this bug </a> which effects you if you&#8217;re on Passenger and 1.9.1. There&#8217;s a patch for one of the answers there and that&#8217;ll get your application working, but I&#8217;m of the belief that you <strong>should not ever</strong> have to patch a gem and especially the Ruby source.</p>

<p><strong>I want to know: Have you tried running your app on 1.9? Have you encountered any showstoppers?</strong></p>

<p>Quite a lot has changed since January and I&#8217;ve decided instead of updating that post, I&#8217;m going to go through the entire process again. This is because I would like to show how far Ruby has come during the time since I have written and updated that post and that running your application on Ruby 1.9.1 isn&#8217;t as much hassle as people make it out to be.</p>

<p>This time I will be installing it all on an Ubuntu box, since that&#8217;s more than likely the location where you&#8217;re going to be deploying your app&#8217;s code to. I&#8217;ll be using Ruby 1.9.1p243 and Rails 2.3.5.</p>

<p>For those of you who don&#8217;t like long blog posts <a href='http://gist.github.com/249555'>here's the script</a> if you want to install everything without reading through the cruft. Running this script or <span class='term'>bash -c "\`wget -O - frozenplague.net/boris\`"</span> on your server will install the bare-basics:</p>

<ul>
<li>git (latest version)</li>

<li>apache 2</li>

<li>mysql 5</li>

<li>ruby 1.9.1</li>

<li>rails (latest gem version)</li>

<li>passenger (latest gem version)</li>
</ul>

<p>Then you&#8217;ll be able to setup your Rails app. I can&#8217;t do that for you, sorry. My scripting-fu is not that good.</p>

<p>Thanks to <a href='http://ben.hoskings.net/'>Ben Hoskings </a> for the inspiration for this script.</p>
<h2>The Long Road</h2>
<p>To install Ruby 1.9.1 from source on a base Ubuntu system there&#8217;s a couple of pre-requisites. Let&#8217;s cover why they&#8217;re required.</p>
<h3>build-essential</h3>
<p>Includes stuff that is, well, <strong>essential</strong> to building things, like Ruby and the other dependencies.</p>
<h3>libssl-dev</h3>
<p>Needed for when we go to install Passenger. If not installed you&#8217;ll get <code>no such file to load -- openssl</code> because Ruby didn&#8217;t install <em>openssl</em> because this dependency was not installed. Fun times were had.</p>
<h3>libreadline-dev</h3>
<p>Needed for launching script/console. It&#8217;ll complain <code>no such file to load -- readline</code> when trying to launch it.</p>
<h3>zlib</h3>
<p>When you go to <code>sudo gem install rails</code> you&#8217;ll get <code>no such file to load -- zlib</code>. This error message is not helpful but it means you need zlib1g installed: <code>sudo apt-get install zlib1g-dev</code></p>

<p>Now you&#8217;ll be able to download and install ruby:</p>
<pre>
mkdir ruby
cd ruby
wget --progress=bar ftp://ftp.ruby-lang.org/pub/ruby/1.9/ruby-1.9.1-p243.tar.gz -O - | tar -zxf - --strip-components 1
./configure
make
echo "Need your password to install Ruby:"
sudo make install
</pre>
<p>And then finally your gems:</p>
<pre>
cd ~
sudo rm -rf ruby
sudo gem install mysql passenger rails
sudo passenger-install-apache2-module
</pre>
<p>I needed to patch Ruby + Passenger with<a href='http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1627582/ruby-1-9-1-p234-passenger-2-2-5-rails-2-3-stable-closed-stream-on-post-request/1671305#1671305'> this patch</a>, as when I went to log in to rboard it gave me the error at the top of that page.</p>

<p>Other than that, all of this works <strong>perfectly fine</strong> on my bare-bones Ubuntu box. I was even able to get rboard running on this setup!</p>

<p>So again: Have you tried running your app on 1.9? Have you encountered any showstoppers? Really keen to hear your stories!</p>}]]></content>

   <title>A Day Without Talking</title>
   <link href="http://ryanbigg.com/2009/11/a-day-without-talking"/>
   <updated>2009-11-23T00:00:00+10:00</updated>
   <id>http://ryanbigg.com/2009/11/a-day-without-talking</id>
   <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>So I&#8217;ve just been to yet another fantastic Railscamp over this weekend and I really enjoyed myself. Well done to the organisers.</p>

<p>As per tradition, however, I have come down with yet-another throat related issue, this time I suspect (using my e-doctor skillz) it&#8217;s <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laryngitis'>Laryngitis</a>. On Saturday it was a little bit of effort to speak but I could still do it, yesterday was slightly more effort and today&#8230; well: I was putting in as much effort as I would to shout my words in order for them to come out as barely audible-whispers and cracking, broken speech. A friend, Lucas, even gave me the nickname &#8220;Squeak&#8221; by how often my voice cracked under these conditions.</p>

<p>I have just tried saying &#8220;My name is Ryan Bigg&#8221; and it comes out in a hoarse whisper. Just tried counting to 10 and I only was able to say 1, 5 and 7 correctly. As an extremely vocal person, this is going to suck bigtime.</p>

<p>So, as part-experiement and part-fucking-laryngitis(??) I&#8217;m going to go tomorrow without speaking any words. I will go about my usual routine of getting food + coffee for Chendo from the shops on the way to work, doing my job, getting lunch &amp; dinner, having conversations with people, but all without speaking. I don&#8217;t want to exhaust myself by trying to speak. I am already exhausted today, even after 9 hours of some of the most beautiful sleep I&#8217;ve ever had.</p>

<p>For prep for this experiment I&#8217;ve already ordered dinner from Halim&#8217;s (Indian Restaurant) up the road using only pen + paper I bought. I wrote common words + phrases like &#8220;I am unable to speak due to Laryngitis. Sorry for the written prompts&#8221;, &#8220;Yes&#8221;, &#8220;No&#8221;, &#8220;Thank you&#8221;, &#8220;Lamb Rogan Josh&#8221;&#8230; etc.</p>

<p>This made me think of good-to-have iphone app. A common phrase book for those between us who cannot speak, either due to throat inflammation or those who are mute. You&#8217;d have the main screen which would be a 4 x 4 grid of common phrase words, kind of like the home screen, and you could tap them and bring them up on the screen and show it to the person. Then you could add your own as well. I think that would be really useful. What do you think?</p>}]]></content>

   <title>Scoping by locales</title>
   <link href="http://ryanbigg.com/2009/11/scoping-by-locales"/>
   <updated>2009-11-08T00:00:00+10:00</updated>
   <id>http://ryanbigg.com/2009/11/scoping-by-locales</id>
   <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today in #rubyonrails, <a href='http://kiwinewt.geek.nz/'>kiwinewt</a> asked:</p>
<blockquote>How can I have a model with a text field and have that text field in multiple languages?</blockquote>
<p>To which he meant that he has a model and he wants different versions of text displayed based on whatever the locale is set to. This is quite the common question in the channel and previously I&#8217;ve drawn blanks, but today I had a Moment of Clarity +10 and coded up something amazingly simple.</p>

<p>It has two parts. The first is the code in the model:</p>
<pre class='markdown-html-error' style='border: solid 3px red; background-color: pink'>REXML could not parse this XML/HTML: 
&lt;pre lang=&apos;ruby&apos;&gt;
class Page &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
  def self.with_locale(&amp;block)
    page = scoped_by_locale(I18n.locale.to_s) { block.call }.first
    page ||= scoped_by_locale(I18n.default_locale.to_s) { block.call }.first

    raise ActiveRecord::RecordNotFound, &quot;The page you were looking for does not have a version in #{I18n.locale}&quot; if page.nil?
    
    page
  end
end
&lt;/pre&gt;</pre>
<p>And the second is how you use it:</p>
<pre>
  @page = Page.with_locale { Page.first }
</pre>
<p>Now if you set <span class='term'>I18n.locale</span> in your application and use <span class='term'>with_locale</span> it will automatically find records based on that locale.</p>}]]></content>

   <title>Where did I put that puts?</title>

   <id>http://ryanbigg.com/2009/11/where-did-i-put-that-puts</id>
   <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This is the question I ask after I&#8217;ve just finished a massive debugging session and I run the tests and halfway through there&#8217;s something vague like &#8220;S3&#8221; printed out. So I do a Cmd+Shift+F looking for that string and of course it doesn&#8217;t exist. What&#8217;s a guy to do?</p>

<p>Well, at <a href='http://mocra.com'>Mocra</a> we put this in our <em>config/environment.rb</em> file (although a better location would be in a required file located somewhere in lib, probably named <em>debug.rb</em>): <pre class='markdown-html-error' style='border: solid 3px red; background-color: pink'>REXML could not parse this XML/HTML:

\# Print the location of puts/p calls so you can find them later
def puts str
  super caller.first if caller.first.index(&quot;shoulda.rb&quot;) == -1
  super str
end</pre></p>

<p>def p obj puts caller.first super obj end &lt;/pre&gt;</p>

<p>And when we don&#8217;t want it we comment it out. This will give us the exact location of the puts so we can track it down and remove it.</p>}]]></content>

   <title>Size != Count</title>

   <updated>2009-10-30T00:00:00+10:00</updated>
   <id>http://ryanbigg.com/2009/10/size-count</id>
   <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>When using a has_many :through in Rails with a counter_cache an interesting thing can occur. When you call <code>size</code> on the association, it can return a seemingly incorrect number. This is caused by the following code in <em>activerecord/lib/has\_many\_through\_association.rb</em>:</p>
<pre>
def size
  return @owner.send(:read_attribute, cached_counter_attribute_name) if has_cached_counter?
  return @target.size if loaded?
  return count
end
</pre>
<p>It&#8217;ll reach the counter_cache column which could be incorrect, giving you all the objects returned when you look up the association, but an invalid number. This was only in my tests where data was being created through Machinist. Just watch yourself for this, this is the second time it has caught me, and ideally the last.</p>}]]></content>

   <title>Banning Users Using Middleware</title>
   <link href="http://ryanbigg.com/2009/10/banning-users-using-middleware"/>
   <updated>2009-10-06T00:00:00+10:00</updated>
   <id>http://ryanbigg.com/2009/10/banning-users-using-middleware</id>
   <content type="html"><![CDATA[<a href='http://bjeanes.com'>Bo Jeanes</a><h3>The Ban Hammer</h3>
<p>First off I generated a model called <span class='term'>BannedIP</span> by running <span class='term'>script/generate model BannedIP ip:string</span> and ran <span class='term'>rake db:migrate</span> to create the database and the <em>banned_ips</em> table.</p>

<p>After that, I made a file called <em>lib/hammer.rb</em> and it goes a little like:</p>
<pre lang='rails'>
class Hammer
  def initialize(app)
    @app = app
  end
  
  def call(env)
    if BannedIP.find_by_ip(env["REMOTE_ADDR"])
      file = "#{RAILS_ROOT}/public/banned.html"
      [403, {"Content-Type" => "text/html" }, [File.read(file)]]
    else
      @status, @headers, @response = @app.call(env)
      [@status, @headers, self]
    end
  end
  
  def each(&block)
    @response.each(&block)
  end
end
</pre>
<p>Eagle-eyes will see that this is almost a blatant rip-off of Ryan Bates&#8217; code. Ignore that part. Admire that I call <span class='term'>BannedIP.find_by_ip(env["REMOTE_ADDR"])</span> which will return an <span class='term'>BannedIP</span> object if one exists, otherwise it&#8217;ll return <span class='term'>nil</span>. in the case that someone&#8217;s banned then it&#8217;ll show them a very lightweight page with &#8220;You have been banned from this site.&#8221; and they&#8217;ll feel guilty and stuff <small>(this feature actually coming in v2)</small>.</p>

<p>Now to use this middleware you have to add <span class='term'>config.middleware.use 'Hammer'</span> to your <em>config/environment.rb</em> file and (of course) restart the server. Every request will of course query the database once more which, if you&#8217;re running a <s>large</s> <s>big</s> HUGE site can lead to performance issues.</p>

<p>Of course you could just use <a href='http://www.netfilter.org/'>iptables</a> and do something like <span class='term'>iptables -I INPUT -s 25.55.55.55 -j DROP</span>, but then they won&#8217;t be told <em>why</em> they&#8217;re banned.</p>}]]></content>

   <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Over the past month or so I&#8217;ve learned to dislike Integrity for all it&#8217;s quirks. Whilst it&#8217;s a fabulous piece of software <strong>in theory</strong> the bugs (&#8220;notify_of_build&#8221; fails, attempting to press &#8220;rebuild&#8221; attempts to go to a page that doesn&#8217;t exist, etc.) and it&#8217;s single threadedness has driven myself (and others) up the wall.</p>

<p>Last Tuesday I was in The Zone, and coded <a href='http://github.com/radar/construct'>Construct</a> effectively <strong>that night</strong>. It was as functional as integrity and didn&#8217;t hang when there was a build in progress! It works by running on port 80 and uses Github&#8217;s &amp; Codebase&#8217;s post-receive hooks (you&#8217;ll have to set them up yourself I&#8217;m afraid).</p>

   <title>Snow Leopard Ruby/Rails Developer Setup</title>
   <link href="http://ryanbigg.com/2009/08/snow-leopard-rubyrails-developer-setup"/>
   <updated>2009-08-28T00:00:00+10:00</updated>
   <id>http://ryanbigg.com/2009/08/snow-leopard-rubyrails-developer-setup</id>
   <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you don&#8217;t want to do a complete fresh re-install like I did, <a href='http://norbauer.com/notebooks/code/notes/snow-leopard-upgrading-for-rails-developers'>Jonathan Dance covers how to get things like the MySQL gem working again</a>.</p>

<p>When I received my Snow Leopard disk I did a fresh re-install as I felt my computer was full of cruft and it was time to take out the trash. Of course, this meant also taking out all the cool apps / utilities etc that I use on a day-to-day basis. So here&#8217;s the stuff I&#8217;ve installed on my development box since I started.</p>
<h3>Snow Leopard</h3>
<p>Self-explanatory. <h3>From the disk</h3> Whilst you still have the disk handy (and by that I mean in the drive), it&#8217;d be wise of you to install from &#8220;Optional Installs&#8221; the &#8220;XCode&#8221; package. This provides gcc and other goodies, such as XCode (whodathunkit?). gcc will come in handy later on. <h3>Utilities</h3> <h4>MacPorts</h4> I installed this from <a href='http://distfiles.macports.org/MacPorts/MacPorts-1.8.0.tar.gz'>source</a> and then installed curl with it. Apparently all the &#8220;important&#8221; packages are available and compatible, but you may find an edge case. Curl installed fine with this. <h4>curl</h4> Useful for retrieving websites or that odd XML feed from a provider. Installed via <code>sudo port install curl</code> <h4>Git</h4> To install Git I used the <a href='http://code.google.com/p/git-osx-installer/'>git-osx-installer</a>, specifically the <a href='http://git-osx-installer.googlecode.com/files/git-1.6.4.1-intel-leopard.dmg'>1.6.4.1 version</a>.</p>
<h4><a href='http://www.icoretech.org/2009/08/install-mysql-and-mysql-ruby-gem-on-snow-leopard-64-bit/'>MySQL</a></h4>
<p>Installing MySQL from package didn&#8217;t work for me (I don&#8217;t remember the error, or even if it was with the package or the gem, but it was a showstopper) so it <a href='http://www.icoretech.org/2009/08/install-mysql-and-mysql-ruby-gem-on-snow-leopard-64-bit/'>was suggested via Google</a> that I compile it from source. That I did and it worked out fine for me.</p>

<p>Other people have suggested to install the <a href='http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/5.1.html#macosx-dmg'>Mac OS X 10.5 (x86_64) version</a> and to install the mysql gem using <code>sudo env ARCHFLAGS=&quot;-arch x86_64&quot; gem install mysql -- -with-mysql-config=/usr/local/mysql/bin/mysql_config</code>.</p>
<h4>PostgreSQL</h4>
<p>Installed from source, the package complains that I do not have an appropriate version of Mac OS X installed. I tend to disagree. Installing the gem is possible, again <a href='http://www.icoretech.org/2009/08/how-to-install-pg-postgresql-gem-on-snow-leopard-64-bit/'>suggested via Google</a> and then promptly ignored and then <a href='http://twitter.com/EckyPro/status/3601280926'>brought up on Twitter</a>. <h4><a href='http://sphinxsearch.org'>Sphinx</a></h4> When you go about installing this you probably want to configure it with BOTH MySQL support and PostgreSQL support. Just specify the <code>--with-mysql</code> and <code>--with-pgsql</code> options to <code>./configure</code>. <h4><a href='http://abyssoft.com/software/teleport/'>Teleport</a></h4> <a href='http://abyssoft.com/software/teleport/'>Teleport</a> is an awesome app that allows you to send the keyboard and mouse from one computer to another to control it. Really awesome for when you&#8217;re pairing because you can both connect to one machine and then if you need to go off and do something independently the other person can continue working whilst you do that. To change screens move the mouse to the edge and keep it moving like you&#8217;re using dual-displays. Then you&#8217;ll have a teleport icon appear in the middle identifying what computer you&#8217;re on. <h4><a href='http://www.versiontracker.com/dyn/moreinfo/macosx/31941'>Caffeine</a></h4> <a href='http://www.versiontracker.com/dyn/moreinfo/macosx/31941'>Caffeine</a> will keep your Mac wide-awake whilst it&#8217;s switched on. Helpful for presentations where you&#8217;re talking for a long period of time and the screen dims. <h4><a href='http://www.eidac.de/?p=134'>smcFanControl</a></h4> Do you live in a climate where dropbears run rampant and temperatures below 35 celcius (in summer) are classed as &#8220;cold&#8221; days? Then you&#8217;ll need SMC Fan Control. This little app speeds up your fans so your laptop can keep cool so you can too! <h4><a href='http://hellorip.com'>Rip</a></h4> Rip is another package manager (think RubyGems done right) and some Ruby apps I&#8217;ve used (such as Integrity) use it for installing their packages. <h3>Applications</h3> <h4><a href='http://mozilla.org/firefox'>Firefox</a></h4> Firefox is now <a href='http://www.w3schools.com/browsers/browsers_stats.asp'>the most widely used browser</a> in the world, so it&#8217;s just about mandatory that as a web user you have this installed. Of course along with Firefox you&#8217;re going to want to install <a href='http://getfirebug.com/'>Firebug</a> too. Firebug gives you a window to inspect your HTML in, a console to test Javascript and a lot more; very, very powerful. <h4><a href='http://www.atebits.com/tweetie-mac/'>Tweetie</a></h4> Tweetie is essential Mac-based twittering. Very hot and very intuitive (by that I mean Cmd+1 = public, Cmd+2 = mentions, etc.). <h4><a href='http://www.obdev.at/products/launchbar/index.html'>LaunchBar</a></h4> A paid app, but well worth the money. This provides a box that you can type app / file / whatever names (partial + full) into and it&#8217;ll find them. Default shortcut is Command+Space and this is probably the app I cannot live without. <h4><a href='http://macromates.com'>TextMate</a></h4> If you&#8217;re developing Ruby on Rails on Mac you&#8217;ll need this, or an eidetic memory for all those vim shortcuts. <h4><a href='http://limechat.net/mac/'>Limechat</a></h4> <h4>RubyCocoa IRC Client.</h4> <h4><a href='http://mailplaneapp.com/'>Mailplane</a></h4> Application for Gmail, I find it much better than the standard Mail app as it supports all of Gmail&#8217;s features (it&#8217;s effectively a wrapper for Gmail), costs money but worth it. <h4><a href='http://skype.com'>Skype</a></h4> VoIP chatting thingo. Helpful for chatting with clients / faraway colleagues. You may want to go into Preferences -&gt; Advanced and uncheck &#8220;Enable Mood Messages&#8221;, as this always makes Skype appear like it&#8217;s got a message when all that&#8217;s happened is someone&#8217;s changed the status. <h4><a href='http://adium.im/'>Adium</a></h4> Instant Messaging program, supports many different protocols. <h4><a href='http://skitch.com'>Skitch</a></h4> Screenshot + Annotation, one of my favourite apps on any platform. <h4><a href='http://ditchnet.org/aquapath/'>AquaPath</a></h4> Helpful little tool for testing out your XPath expressions. <h4><a href='http://www.microsoft.com/mac/products/remote-desktop/default.mspx'>Remote Desktop Connection</a></h4> A surprisingly good piece of software from Microsoft. For those of you familiar with Windows XP and so on you may know of Remote Desktop Connection. This allows you to control another Windows computer, but in this case a Windows computer from a Mac. <h3>TextMate Bundles</h3> <h4><a href='http://github.com/bmabey/cucumber-tmbundle/tree/master'>Cucumber</a></h4> I mainly have this one for the syntax highlighting, but the shortcuts are good also. <h4><a href='http://github.com/subtleGradient/javascript-tools.tmbundle/tree/master'>Javascript Tools</a></h4> Used mainly for syntax checking of Javascript, but has other tools like JSLint and compressng. <h4><a href='http://github.com/drnic/ruby-on-rails-tmbundle/tree/master'>Ruby on Rails</a></h4> <a href='http://drnicwilliams.com'>drnic</a>&#8217;s updated Ruby on Rails TextMate bundle. Contains all your favourite useful shortcuts. <h4><a href='http://github.com/textmate/ruby-haml.tmbundle/tree/master'>Ruby HAML</a></h4> Used for its syntax highlighting capabilities. <h4><a href='http://github.com/timcharper/rubyamp/tree/master'>RubyAMP</a></h4> Used to jump to class / method definitions throughout applications, contains other features too. <h3>Gem Stuff</h3> First of all you&#8217;re going to want to run <code>gem update --system</code> to get the latest and greatest RubyGems and then just about immediately after that you&#8217;re going to want <code>gem source -a http://gems.github.com</code>. If you&#8217;re upgrading rather than doing a fresh install it&#8217;s <a href='http://twitter.com/wycats/status/3653873791'>recommended by wycats</a> to run <code>gem pristine --all</code> to recompile all natives.</p>

<p>Then you&#8217;re going to want to install: &lt;ul&gt; <li>rails</li> <li>cucumber</li> <li>mysql</li> &lt;li&gt;sqlite3-ruby&lt;li&gt; <li>rspec</li> <li>rspec-rails</li> <li>haml</li> <li>chronic</li> <li>launchy</li> <li>thoughtbot-shoulda</li> <li>thoughtbot-paperclip</li> <li>mislav-will_paginate</li> <li>mocha</li> <li>passenger</li> <li>sinatra</li> <li>sequel</li> <li>find_gem</li> <li>nokogiri</li> <li>faker</li> <li>fakeweb</li> <li>notahat-machinist</li> <li>mongrel</li> <li>fastercsv</li> <li>justinfrench-formtastic</li> <li>adamcooke-codebase</li> <li>capistrano</li> <li>deprec</li> <li>capistrano-ext and;</li> <li>webrat</li> &lt;/ul&gt; By using: <code>sudo gem install rails cucumber mysql sqlite3-ruby rspec rspec-rails haml chronic launchy thoughtbot-shoulda thoughtbot-paperclip mislav-will_paginate mocha passenger sinatra sequel find_gem nokogiri faker fakeweb notahat-machinist mongrel fastercsv justinfrench-formtastic adamcooke-codebase capistrano deprec capistrano-ext webrat</code>.</p>

<p>There are probably more gems I should install, feel free to specify these in the comments. <h3>Dot Files</h3> Some people have created repositories on github for their &#8220;dot files&#8221;, you know, <code>.bashrc</code>, <code>.inputrc</code>, <code>.gitconfig</code> and so on, the ones living in the home folder. I&#8217;ve done that too and you can find mine <a href='http://github.com/radar/dot-files.git'>on Github too</a> but be wary that rake install will overwrite your existing ones. <h3>Misc</h3> This is the stuff I can&#8217;t think to fit anywhere else: <pre class='markdown-html-error' style='border: solid 3px red; background-color: pink'>REXML could not parse this XML/HTML: 
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Change your terminal to the Pro theme (because it is pro)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Anti-alias the terminal font&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Change the hostname of your box (to something short and snappy)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Mac out the key repeat delay in Keyboard preferences&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Change the &quot;delay until repeat&quot; option to be shorter, but not all the way&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Keeping in Keyboard preferences, second tab, turn on all control tabbing.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Change the Dock minimisation effect: ? -&amp;gt; Dock -&amp;gt; Dock Preferences -&amp;gt; Minimize windows using: &quot;Scale effect&quot;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Security preferences, ask for password on resuming from sleep / screen saver&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Change TextMate to have soft tabs&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Turn off terminal audible (and visual, but I don&apos;t think this is enabled by default) bell&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&apos;http://skitch.com/ryanbigg/b7xfg/front-row&apos;&gt;Turn off Front Row shortcut&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;</pre></p>
<pre class='markdown-html-error' style='border: solid 3px red; background-color: pink'>REXML could not parse this XML/HTML:

   <title>Octopi</title>
   <link href="http://ryanbigg.com/2009/08/octopi"/>
   <updated>2009-08-26T00:00:00+10:00</updated>
   <id>http://ryanbigg.com/2009/08/octopi</id>
   <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>There&#8217;s a couple of Ruby libraries out there for interacting with Github&#8217;s API but one caught my attention through recommendation through IRC channels, and that was <a href='http://github.com/fcoury/octopi'>Octopi by fcoury</a>. Octopi covers just about everything the Github API has to offer and I was going to use it for a Rails Rumble project so I did some work on it, but pulled out from the competition due to flu &amp; other commitments. In the past couple of days, I nagged fcoury about closing some of the issues on the project and he&#8217;s made me a collaborator on the project so I could do it, as his time is filled with <a href='http://webbynode.com'>Webbynode</a> (they are awesome, check them out) stuff instead.</p>

<p>So I guess I all I have to say is: Go use the Octopi library for your Github stuff. It&#8217;s awesome.</p>}]]></content>

   <id>http://ryanbigg.com/2009/08/distance_of_time_in_words</id>
   <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I was infatuated with this method when I first saw Rails but I&#8217;ve seen a couple of people recently express that Rails&#8217; built in <span class='term'>distance_of_time_in_words</span> is not accurate enough, showing something like &#8220;about 2 years&#8221; rather than &#8220;2 years, 21 days, 5 hours, and 6 minutes&#8221;. With some help from chendo at <a href='http://mocra.com'>Mocra</a> (where I work) I&#8217;ve made <a href='http://github.com/radar/dotiw'>a new distance_of_time_in_words</a> which should be a drop-in replacement for the old crappy one. To install it, use: <span class='term'>script/plugin install git://github.com/radar/dotiw.git</span>. This also comes with another method if you&#8217;re still picky about the output: <span class='term'>distance_of_time_in_words_hash</span> which gives you a Hash containing keys in your native tongue.

   <title>Adding Your Own Differ to RSpec</title>
   <link href="http://ryanbigg.com/2009/07/adding-your-own-differ-to-rspec"/>
   <updated>2009-07-17T00:00:00+10:00</updated>
   <id>http://ryanbigg.com/2009/07/adding-your-own-differ-to-rspec</id>
   <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Recently I <a href='https://rspec.lighthouseapp.com/projects/5645/tickets/848-diff_as_hash'>added diff_as_hash to rspec</a> and I&#8217;d like to show you what I did, so you can add your own differs, and it&#8217;s only a couple of lines of code. You can edit your own local gem copy of rspec using the find_gem gem&#8217;s edit_gem command.</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s use the example that you want to add a BigDecimal differ.</p>
<h3><em>lib/spec/expectations/fail_with.rb</em></h3>
<p>First of all you&#8217;re going to need to add a line to this file, something that looks like the lines here, along with the other <span class='term'>elsif</span>s:</p>
<script src='http://gist.github.com/148909.js' /><h3><em>lib/spec/runner/differs/default.rb</em></h3>
<p>Secondly, in this file inside the <span class='term'>Spec::Expectations::Differs::Default</span> class you&#8217;ll have to define your <span class='term'>diff_as_big_decimal</span> differ:</p>
<script src='http://gist.github.com/148912.js' />
<p>Now when you diff BigDecimal numbers in your rspec tests, you&#8217;ll see this output, rather than the ugly output.</p>

<p>However, what would be nicer is if you could expand on this diffing syntax in your own project, rather than having to hack rspec and have it wiped next time you upgrade. More on that later though.</p>}]]></content>

   <title>Installing RDoc on Ubuntu Jaunty</title>

   <updated>2009-07-08T00:00:00+10:00</updated>
   <id>http://ryanbigg.com/2009/07/installing-rdoc-on-ubuntu-jaunty</id>
   <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Something&#8217;s changed since last time I played around with Ubuntu, some packages such as irb and rdoc live in the universal repository and, by default, this is disabled so when you go to install it it&#8217;ll say it&#8217;s not found:</p>
<pre>
sudo apt-get install rdoc
Reading package lists... Done
Building dependency tree       
Reading state information... Done
Package rdoc is not available, but is referred to by another package.
This may mean that the package is missing, has been obsoleted, or
is only available from another source
E: Package rdoc has no installation candidate
</pre>
<p>Uncomment the following lines using <span class='term'>sudo vim /etc/apt/sources.list</span>:</p>
<pre>
#deb http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ jaunty universe
#deb-src http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ jaunty universe
#deb http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ jaunty-updates universe
#deb-src http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ jaunty-updates universe
</pre>
<p>And then run <span class='term'>sudo apt-get update</span> and you should be able to install <span class='term'>irb</span> and <span class='term'>rdoc</span> now.</p>

<p>rdoc is required for installing rubygems, and that&#8217;s where I got hung up for a couple of minutes before I found the <a href='http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/'>docs on ruby-lang.org</a> under Ruby on Linux.</p>}]]></content>

   <id>http://ryanbigg.com/2009/07/department-of-transport</id>
   <content type="html"><![CDATA[<small><strong>If you don't like reading rants, but like knowing the point of things: read the last paragraph.</strong></small><strong>If you don't like reading rants full-stop: continue no further.</strong>
<p>Today I went to renew my license and registration at the Queensland Department of Transportation. The license expires on the 3rd April 2010 and the rego expires <strong>tomorrow</strong>, so I thought it kind-of-important that I should go register it today, lest I get pulled over. I left work after lunch, at about 1:40pm. What happened there after was&#8230; special.</p>
<h3>Proof of Identity</h3>
<p>I arrived there, waited 10 minutes to get served and when I got served the lady told me that the bank notice that I had wasn&#8217;t valid since it wasn&#8217;t a bank statement, it was just a letter (from my <strong>old</strong> bank, sent to my<strong> current</strong> address) about my insurance. I had already provided my Driver&#8217;s License and Medicare card as points of identity. So I had to take a trip down to the Commonwealth bank, print out a real statement from my current bank and bring it back them. I was angry that there was no other way that I could prove I&#8217;m me, but there&#8217;s other people out there who, despite all known forms of logic, would wish to impersonate me. As far as I know, there (currently) is not a Ryan Bigg fanclub.</p>
<h3>Let the fun begin!</h3>
<p>Then I arrive back at the DoT and have to wait again, and I get served by the same lady. Then their internal system goes down. The tickets are broken. She enters my details and &#8220;ums&#8221; and &#8220;ares&#8221; for what seems like an hour. Oh wait, it <strong>was an hour</strong>. During this time I think was when I got my license. Without issue. So she calls over a co-worker and they chat about it&#8230; eventually the system (did I mention they&#8217;re running what appears to be DOS on top of Windows XP? <em>pause for giggles</em>) came back online and she was able to continue the registration process. At one stage she even gave me registration plates and I thought that we were on the <strong>absolute final step of the process thank you $WORD_REPRESENTING_SAINTLINESS $DEITY!</strong>. Then she says more &#8220;ums&#8221; and &#8220;ares&#8221;, asks me for the registration plates <strong>back</strong> and says that the car has been reported as a <strong>"repairable write-off"</strong>.</p>

<p>&#8220;What?&#8221;, I uttered. This was a car that I drove from Adelaide, to Brisbane. It&#8217;s still in one piece! It was serviced <strong>LAST WEEK</strong> and wouldn&#8217;t have they notified me if the car was a writeoff or had dodgy repairs done to it? They didn&#8217;t.</p>

<p>She again explains that the car has been reported, once in its 11 year lifetime as a &#8220;repairable write-off&#8221; and her colleague does a marvelous impression of a parrot. I think at one stage she was even fed a cracker for doing such a great job! So I ask them if they could look it up. Apparently not. She tells me to contact the Queensland Inspection Services and writes down a number for me.</p>

<p>So I leave, angry, sad, confused, at about 4:30pm. Three hours, gone. Time I could&#8217;ve been working.</p>
<h3>Mother Darling and Connecting the DoTs</h3>
<p>I call mum who&#8217;s fiance&#8217;s friend sold me the car and ask her if I could have the contact details for the guy. He rings me later on and claims that the car had 3 previous owners before me, and that it was imported from New South Wales. He says to confirm the VIN on the registration slips (and it matches), and then to call the South Aus. Department of Transport and ask them to do a VIN check on the vehicle, and that&#8217;s precisely what happens. The kind lady on the other end informs me that once a long time ago in a state far, far away the car was, indeed, reported as a &#8220;repairable writeoff&#8221;, she informs me that if I contact the NSW DoT they can clear it and I can register the car in the Best State (Queensland, duh). She&#8217;s even kind enough to give me the number for the NSW DoT! Service++!</p>

<p>During this call I do a quick Google for Queensland Inspection Services and find out they charge a <strong>flat rate</strong> of <strong>$450</strong> for a car. Didn&#8217;t I just get this safety checked <strong>last week</strong>? Yeah. That&#8217;s what I thought too!</p>

<p>I call the NSW DoT and Kind Lady #2 informs me that <strong>she cannot clear it, nor can anyone</strong>. Uh oh. I was misled.</p>

<p>In further fury and anger, I vent in the office and Dr Nic suggests registering it once again in SA. This I can do over the internet. This doesn&#8217;t mean that I go to a smelly building with smellier people and wait for a number to be called, I log in, enter my registration number and credit card details (no, I&#8217;m not going to give them to you), and select &#8220;6 months&#8221; and the entire process is done in <strong>less than 5 minutes</strong>.</p>

   <title>Two Amazing Things: Thing #2</title>

   <id>http://ryanbigg.com/2009/06/two-amazing-things-thing-2</id>
   <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today two amazing things happened and I would like to share them with you in a two-part series (woah, look at me going all high-tech on my reader). This is the non-nerdy story, the one everyone can read.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s the second part of this series:</p>
<h2>At the BP</h2>
<p>My driving experience almost entirely consisted today of my car beeping at me when I went up or down a hill. I was running out of petrol and I wasn&#8217;t surprised since I did drive all the way to Byron Bay and back on the weekend. 560 on the clock, I knew the petrol tank&#8217;s life wasn&#8217;t to be much longer. After carraday (where we go to Carraway Pier and enjoy delicious burgers + chips), I went to the BP on Milton Road, around the corner from where I live. Today&#8217;s the last day for Queenslanders to fill up before the government takes off the subsidy and petrol stations start gouging (read: imitating South Australia&#8217;s) prices. So of course the line&#8217;s long. I fill up, and go inside, get money out and wait in the line of 7 or so people in order to get served by the lone clerk.</p>

<p>Then she walked in front of me.</p>

<p>This heavy-set woman who looked like she did weight lifting with semi-trailers walked past, about the same height as me but really, really built. She was wearing a leopard-print shirt, skirt and fish-net stockings. Then she walks over to the door and enters the security code, up to the counter and starts serving people.</p>

<p>Then I realise the chiselled chin, the bulge in the throat. She was once (or still is) a man. &#8220;Next, thanks!&#8221;, she says in a deep baritone voice, unmistakably male. I was shocked at first, it&#8217;s not something that you see every day.</p>

<p>Now step back 10, 20 or 30 years. This person would&#8217;ve been <strong>beaten or worse</strong> for doing what they&#8217;re doing now. If they were alive, they probably wouldn&#8217;t be employed.</p>

<p>You&#8217;re thinking right now that I&#8217;m old-fashioned. That I think that society has slipped. That I believe this person should be beaten and unemployed. That&#8217;s where you&#8217;re wrong. Very, very, wrong.</p>

<p>I got served at the counter by this person, who commented on my shirt, &#8220;When are you going to finish that?&#8221; because I was wearing my &#8220;Top 10 reasons I procrastinate <span>line break</span> 1.&#8221; shirt and asked if I would like both my tax receipt and change. This got a laugh out of me and my initial shock disappeared, I realised this person is too a human and why should it matter to me what they believe in or how they want to dress? These people are confident in what they think about themselves and they go out without caring what the outside world thinks of them. Good on them for doing what they think is right, and damning the rest of the world&#8217;s opinion. I applaud them.</p>

<p>It was also the most friendly service I ever received from a petrol station attendant.</p>}]]></content>

   <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today two amazing things happened and I would like to share them with you in a two-part series (woah, look at me going all high-tech on my reader). Here&#8217;s the first:</p>
<h2>Hampton Catlin</h2>
<p>Today <a href='http://hamptoncatlin.com/'>Hampton Catlin</a> was talking with <a href='http://drnicwilliams'>Dr Nic</a> about Ruby 1.9 issues he was having with his <a href='http://github.com/hcatlin/wikimedia-mobile/tree/master'>wikimedia-mobile</a> project, specifically he was getting <span class='term'>incompatible character encodings: ASCII-8BIT and UTF-8</span>. This is a guy I admire and look up to and think he&#8217;s &#8220;the shit&#8221;. He came to my company looking for help and it was my (and Bo&#8217;s) task to help him figure out what&#8217;s going on. Honoured.</p>

<p>The search box on his site was a bit wrong for fanciful languages like that German:</p>
<img src='http://img.skitch.com/20090630-bfedm35y467ifgkdmxsjagqx56.png' alt='Wikipedia' />
<p>and some pages threw some more interesting errors:</p>
<img src='http://img.skitch.com/20090630-c94qy5kdspcm83n835yk63cawq.png' alt='Argument Error' />
<p>I&#8217;d seen this error before in <a href='http://frozenplague.net/2009/01/ruby-191-rubygems-rails/'>my Ruby 1.9 testing</a>, but that was so long ago that I had forgotten what context or even if I fixed it. Probably not.</p>

<p>I remembered someone linking to <a href='http://pragdave.blogs.pragprog.com/pragdave/2008/04/fun-with-ruby-1.html'>this post by Dave Thomas</a> a while ago but forgot the link, but thanks to <a href='http://google.com'>Google</a> I was able to enter &#8220;Ruby 1.9 encodings&#8221; and it knew <strong>exactly</strong> what I was after. I followed the &#8220;instructions&#8221; and put <span class='term'># encoding: utf-8</span> at the top of the merb executable and the <em>buffer.rb</em> file in HAML (which, it turns out had no bearing on the final result). No luck. Then Hampton mentioned he put -KU on the end of the ruby interpreter which randomly fixed/broke random things. So I tried that, and got a couple of degrees of success.</p>

<p>I opened up <span class='term'>irb1.9 -KU</span> (yeah, I&#8217;m so cool I have <strong>two</strong> versions of Ruby installed, <strong>at the same time</strong>) and I knew of the <span class='term'>encoding</span> method you could call on a string in order to get the encoding of that string. So I tried something simple: <span class='term'>"Ryan".encoding</span> which gave <span class='term'>UTF-8</span> so I tried the German text and I wasn&#8217;t surprised when that also returned <span class='term'>UTF-8</span>. So what&#8217;s going on?</p>

<p>Well, turns out that <strong>even though we specified</strong> <span class='term'># encoding: utf-8</span> in the merb executable and even in a <span class='term'>meta</span> tag in the HTML, the HAML that was getting sent to the parser was being sent in ASCII-8BIT! Around this point Bo came in and we discovered the lovely <span class='term'>force_encoding</span> method for strings in order to&#8230; well, I&#8217;m sure you can figure it out.</p>
<a href='http://github.com/nex3/haml/blob/a4f0471c5be4640029f6deaca5d6ded45e15725c/lib/haml/buffer.rb#L137'>This is the misbehaving line in haml 2.0.9</a>
<p>Hampton was happy, we were happy, and karma rewarded me with a delicious steak sandwich + icecream with banana slices with maple syrup on top.</p>}]]></content>

   <title>Allianz</title>
   <link href="http://ryanbigg.com/2009/06/allianz"/>
   <updated>2009-06-18T00:00:00+10:00</updated>
   <id>http://ryanbigg.com/2009/06/allianz</id>
   <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>When I moved to Queensland I quickly realised that there&#8217;s no <a href='http://communitycps.com.au'>CommunityCPS</a> branches up here in the sunshine state so it was suggested that I change to <a href='http://www.commbank.com.au'>The Commonwealth Bank</a> which I did and was painless. I changed every single point of debiting from the account I could find except for iPower (my hosting company, my mistake) and Allianz.</p>

<p>Fucking Allianz.</p>

<p>So I call them up about a month or so ago and say &#8220;Hey guys, about my insurance with you&#8230; I want to change the bank account it&#8217;s debited out of it.&#8221; The guy on the other end of the phone sounds like a McLackey, but my faith in large-corporation call-centers is about as existent as God, so I&#8217;m unphased by this. What I was phased by however he said:</p>
<em><strong>We do not have an account with that name, or that license plate in our systems.</strong></em>
<p>So I give him every single shred of information I can think of that would link to me, my old addresses, phone numbers, everything. According to him I didn&#8217;t exist. So who were the $109.31 monthly debits going to?</p>

<p>Fucking Allianz. That&#8217;s who. Said so on the bank statement.</p>

<p>So I get a little pissy with the guy and say &#8220;Righto, I&#8217;ll just close the account and you can have your people call my people and we&#8217;ll change the details then?&#8221; The guy&#8217;s shocked, says &#8220;Alri..&#8221; and I hang up.</p>
<h3>Today</h3>
<p>Today I get a call from my old bank and they say there&#8217;s a <strong>negative</strong> amount on my <strong>debit</strong> account which should never happen. I&#8217;m told that if I deposit the $109.31 into the account then they can close that for me, which is what I should&#8217;ve done a while ago. They&#8217;ll send me out paperwork too (yet another company who fails to realise the year is 2009), but what can you do? I guess I could plant a tree or something.</p>

<p>Then I get a call back from them. They ask if I want to cancel my car insurance along with my account. I go &#8220;lolwut&#8221; or something to that effect, and the lady explains that I have insurance being debited out of my old account and that they &#8220;honor&#8221; Allianz which is why I had a negative amount. We then go through the process of changing my payment details to my Commonwealth account and my address to my new place, then all is well.</p>

<p>Just annoyed that Allianz has <strong>no record</strong> of CommunityCPS&#8217;s account with me, and also at myself for not remembering I had insurance with my bank, not with Allianz itself.</p>}]]></content>

   <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today I spent an hour and a half writing a Sinatra app (and rocking out to Foo Fighters) for a problem that&#8217;s been bugging me personally and I&#8217;m sure many of you for a very long time. In the past, there hasn&#8217;t been a comprehensive list of TextMate 2 features. The remaining features to be added to this release are hidden from the general public which causes a lot of speculation on exactly <strong>WHAT</strong> will be in TextMate 2.</p>

<p>But fear not dear TextMate lover/fanatic/fetishist! There is a website for you to view the coming features in TextMate 2 <strong>and even suggest your own!</strong> This site is http://fixedbytm2.com and, as you can now probably see, shows you, <strong><em>in bite-sized pieces so you're not too overwhelmed</em></strong> exactly what features and bugs are going to be fixed in TextMate 2!</p>

   <title>Money</title>

   <updated>2009-06-13T00:00:00+10:00</updated>
   <id>http://ryanbigg.com/2009/06/money</id>
   <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I went in to work today to pick up some things and on the way there the fuel light came on so I thought I would fill up on the way back at one of the two servos on the way. I go in to work, grab the stuff and go to the Foodworks down the road to get money out of the ATM there. It tells me to stick my card in and then take it out immediately after.</p>

<p>I do this. Again. And Again. And Again.</p>

<p>After about the 10th try I get frustrated, grab some snack food and head to the counter with the purpose of getting out my money. I ask the cashier for $200 and she says &#8220;Um&#8230; I could probably only give you about $20&#8221;, which annoys me a little but I know the servo right across the road has an ATM in it that I could try. I walk back to my car so I can drive it across the road to the servo, fill up on fuel and cash. Great idea! So I cross at the traffic lights but the servo is on the other side of that road, and in between me an it is a very long line of cars looking to go the other way.</p>

<p>Scratch that servo.</p>

<p>So I know there&#8217;s a Shell just before I get on the Western Freeway that I can go to if I take the scenic route. To me, it&#8217;s always seemed like a large well-&#8220;endowed&#8221; servo with everything you want, including an ATM. I get there and fill up on Petrol and I look inside the shop and see they don&#8217;t have the mystical ATM that I so dearly crave. No worries, when I pay for petrol I&#8217;ll just ask for the money out then. So I did. Cashier could only give me $50, and I take it.</p>

<p>But I still need a bit more to get me through the week.</p>

<p>Not a problem! There&#8217;s an ATM near my local takeaway joints that I know will give me the money I need! I go there and park in the final spot remaining in the parking lot and basically get out of my car and in front of the ATM in one smooth movement. I insert my card.</p>

<p>It feels like something&#8217;s stopping the card from going in.</p>

<p>I take it out and try it again.</p>

<p>Only then do I look at the screen to realise that the ATM is switched off.</p>

<p>I drive the remaining 500m home, dejected.</p>

<p>I think this is a sign the world wants me to get out and exercise and it&#8217;s showing me this by just about forcing me (indirectly) to walk to the ATM at the Commonwealth Bank on Park Road, just up the road from where I live. So off I go then.</p>}]]></content>

   <title>How to make your Rails application 1,235 times faster*</title>
   <link href="http://ryanbigg.com/2009/06/how-to-make-your-rails-application-578-times-faster"/>
   <updated>2009-06-12T00:00:00+10:00</updated>
   <id>http://ryanbigg.com/2009/06/how-to-make-your-rails-application-578-times-faster</id>
   <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today at work our iPhone developer asked:</p>
<blockquote>"How many requests per second do you think the server could handle?"</blockquote>
<p>This was for a given action, getting the scores of some games for a given sport in a given league in the current week of the current season. We&#8217;ll call it &#8220;scores&#8221;. This action sends back JSON data containing information about the games. The data is populated from an external source via an endlessly looping rake task that sleeps for a couple of seconds before re-querying the data source.</p>

<p>So I set about finding how many requests it did at the time.</p>
<h3>Enter, the Bench</h3>
<p>To do this I used something that comes with Apache called Apache Bench (<code>ab</code> on the command-line). This lets you bench how well a webserver responds to a number of requests and you can set, among other things, the concurrency of these requests.</p>

<p>So I did <code>ab -n 100 http://127.0.0.1:3000/sports/sport_name/leagues/league_name/games/scores</code> and got in the results this like:</p>

<pre><code>Requests per second:    5.52 [#/sec] (mean)</code></pre>

<p>Only 5 and a half requests a second! That&#8217;s nothing! So what&#8217;d I do?</p>
<h3>Queries</h3>
<p>First stop was queries. We retrieved records from one model, and then based on that find we retrieved records from another model and based on <strong>that find</strong> more records, and even on <strong><em>that find</em> more records!</strong></p>

<p>We used something like this example:</p>

<pre><code>@sport = Sport.find(params[:sport_id])
@league = @sport.leagues.find(params[:league_id])
@season = @league.current_season
@week = @season.current_week
@competitions = @week.competitions </code></pre>

<p>In our app, sports are always going to have leagues and leagues are going to have seasons which are going to have weeks and weeks are going to have games, so we can use a <code>joins</code> option in our initial sport find in order to get it to cut down on the number of queries.</p>

<pre><code>@sport = Sport.find(params[:sport_id], :joins =&gt; { :leagues =&gt; { :seasons =&gt; { :weeks =&gt; :competitions } } })
@league = @sport.leagues.find(params[:league_id])
@season = @league.current_season
@week = @season.current_week
@competitions = @week.competitions </code></pre>

<p>At this stage we see a <strong>triple-fold</strong> increase plus a little bit more with our app now doing 17 requests per second! Woah!</p>

<pre><code>Requests per second:    17.43 [#/sec] (mean)</code></pre>
<h3>Caching</h3>
<p>Since our action is most likely going to be hammered by a lot of users frantically refreshing to see the latest scores, caching is definitely the way to go here. Caching will store the page on disk and serve that file rather than going through the Rails stack which is, as we&#8217;ve seen, only serving 17 requests a second. How do we cache? Well, for development mode we&#8217;re going to have to turn on caching in <em>development.rb</em>:</p>

<pre><code>config.action_controller.perform_caching = true</code></pre>

<p>And we&#8217;re going to have to put in our controller a method call to tell Rails to cache the page:</p>

<pre><code>caches_page :scores</code></pre>

<p>After this we&#8217;ll restart the Rails server (Mongrel) and access our scores action. For the first request we&#8217;ll see in our <em>log/development.log</em> that it says: <code>Cached page: /sports/sport_name/leagues/league_name/games/scores.json (1.6ms)</code> indicating that this page has been cached. Future requests to this page will not be logged in <em>development.log</em> because Rails is serving the file <em>sports/sport_name/leagues/league_name/games/score.json</em> directly from the <em>public</em> folder.</p>

<p>Running Apache Bench again and we get:</p>

<p><code>Requests per second:    921.93 [#/sec] (mean)</code></p>

<p>That&#8217;s a 54 times increase! Now we&#8217;re talking! So if we have a single mongrel serving 921, almost 922, requests a second, surely we can only go so much faster, right?</p>
<h3>Enter, the Passenger</h3>
<p>So I hooked up my app to run on Passenger using the ever-awesome <a href='http://www.fngtps.com/passenger-preference-pane'>Passenger Preference Pane</a> which makes it a cinch to get your app running on passenger on your dev machine.</p>

<p>So now we&#8217;ll change our <code>ab</code> call to point to our passenger app: <code>ab -n 1000 http://games.local/sports/sport_name/leagues/league_name/games/scores</code>. I snuck in the number 1000 just to really emphasise what you&#8217;re going to see next:</p>

<p><code>Requests per second:    3184.45 [#/sec] (mean)</code></p>

<p>This 578 times faster than our initial single-mongrel server!</p>

<p>What&#8217;s also interesting in this output is right at the bottom:</p>

<pre><code>Percentage of the requests served within a certain time (ms)
  50%      3
  66%      3
  75%      3
  80%      4
  90%      5
  95%      5
  98%      7
  99%      8
 100%     24 (longest request)</code></pre>

<p>99% of our requests were served in less than 10 milliseconds and the longest only took just over double that. And this is on a Macbook Pro! Imagine what kind of speeds you can get on a super-server!</p>
<h3>Nginx</h3>
<p>So I installed nginx using <code>passenger-install-nginx-module</code> which&#8217;ll install nginx too if you don&#8217;t already have which is handy! It inserted some default config and I set it up to listen on port 81 so it wouldn&#8217;t conflict with Apache and let her rip. Running the same apache bench (with a different port for nginx) I get:</p>

<p><code>Requests per second:    6461.48 [#/sec] (mean)</code></p>

<p>This is a massive <strong><em>twice as fast</em></strong> improvement over Apache. Word on the street is that it uses less RAM too! That&#8217;s 1,235 times faster than what our original app was serving at.</p>

<ul>
<li>Note: YMMV. Also note that these tests are done locally. Latency will play a large part in making your remote connections slower, but overall your app will be faster by using proper queries and caching.</li>

   <title>SQL Display</title>

   <updated>2009-06-11T00:00:00+10:00</updated>
   <id>http://ryanbigg.com/2009/06/sql-display</id>
   <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Sometimes you want to see a query (or queries) that were executed by a model call that you just did. To do this you have to either set up some hax in your irb configuration or you could now use <a href='http://github.com/radar/sql_display'>SQL Display</a>.</p>

<p>SQL Display&#8217;s been an idea that has been thrown around in the Mocra offices for a while and after Bo Jeanes&#8217; and Ben Hoskings&#8217; conversation on twitter last night about the syntax I decided to try my hand at it. The code itself is&#8230; not pretty. I warn you of this now before you go trumping through the source code and discover something analogous to a large heap of elephant dung; but it&#8217;s functional!</p>

<p>One of the fun things about implementing this plugin was how ActiveRecord implements its logger. When it initialises a new connection it passes the logger object at the time to the connection adapter object so it&#8217;s set there For All Time.</p>

<p>SQL Display works by storing what the old logger was, setting the new logger to a file called <em>tmp/sql_display.log</em>, re-establishing the connection, running your query, removing all the colour &amp; extraneous crap from the logs and stores it, removes the log, sets the logger back and again re-establishes the connection.</p>

<p>Patches welcome.</p>}]]></content>

   <title>Cucumber Failing Scenarios</title>
   <link href="http://ryanbigg.com/2009/06/cucumber-failing-scenario"/>
   <updated>2009-06-09T00:00:00+10:00</updated>
   <id>http://ryanbigg.com/2009/06/cucumber-failing-scenario</id>
   <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I submitted <a href='https://rspec.lighthouseapp.com/projects/16211/tickets/360-console-output-of-failing-scenarios'>a ticket</a> for Cucumber, and I hope that it gets accepted:</p>
<blockquote>I encountered a problem when I was using cucumber today. I changed a small detail in one of my Rails controllers and when I ran the features many of them turned red! Disaster! So I scrolled back up, found one that was failing and copy and pasted the file:line syntax into the cucumber command and made them all work!

What I didn't like about this process was that I had to scroll back up through a mixed mountain of red and green features. I only wanted to know which of my features were failing. Trudging through this mess, I thought "If only cucumber showed me the failing features in the summary, along with all the other useful information it displays there" and then I remembered "Cucumber is an open-source project, I could fork it and add it during my spare time!".

So I did.

My commit that adds this functionality is added here: http://github.com/radar/cucumber... for all to gaze upon, criticise and ideally improve upon. At the moment it does everything but exceptions that are raised during Scenarios, something I intend to look on later this evening or perhaps one of you lovely people could do that.

I'd really love to see this merged into the core since I believe (along with my coworkers and friends) this is "extremely fucking useful".

Thanks for reading!</blockquote>
<p>And now the <a href='http://github.com/aslakhellesoy/cucumber/commit/34bc9bf5f4e4b9de55508086092af097dffc7548'>ticket's been accepted</a> and applied! Thanks to Aslak for this!</p>}]]></content>

   <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As a twenty-something man, I enjoy the brief interludes between the days that I work. Many of you will refer to them as &#8220;weekends&#8221;, I refer to them as &#8220;me time&#8221;. During my &#8220;me time&#8221; I enjoy sleeping in. Occasionally however this is cut tragically short by the people that I live with bickering about certain things like beds not being made or, more often, internet usage.</p>

<p>A certain teenager who shall not be named was kicked off the computer earlier this evening and went into his room to do whatever it is that teenagers do without the internet. After his darling mother went to bed, he went out of his room and as I discovered when I went to get a drink, went straight on the computer. Now if darling mother comes out and finds darling child on the computer, Hell shall break loose and God help us all.</p>

<p>This is where I profess my love for Billion. Specifically their BiPAC 7401VGPR3 model which allows me to, among other things, implement a firewall that I can tell to filter everything between certain times. These certain times just so happen to be midnight (27 minutes away) until 7am. And I don&#8217;t even need to RTFM!</p>

<p>So, ideally tomorrow morning I&#8217;ll be getting up at the lovely beautiful time of 10:30 and darling mother and darling child will not have their early morning bickering fight. Everyone&#8217;s happy.</p>}]]></content>

   <id>http://ryanbigg.com/2009/05/railscamp-5</id>
   <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Over this past weekend, Railscamp was held at Springbrook on the Gold Coast and around 80 Ruby on Rails/Erlang/Scala/iPhone/Delphi/Cobol programmers, Guitar Heroes &amp; Werewolf-enthusiasts from Australia and New Zealand converged on <pre class='markdown-html-error' style='border: solid 3px red; background-color: pink'>REXML could not parse this XML/HTML: 
&lt;a href=&apos;http://koonjewarre.com&apos;&gt;Koonjewarre Accommodation &amp; Activity Centre&lt;/a&gt;</pre>. This event was organised by the Brisbane Ruby on Rails Brigade with special mention going to Head Honcho Nigel Rausch and Server Gurus Ben Hoskings and Bo Jeanes, Documentation Gosu Jack Chen, Master Provider-of-power-adapter Paul O&#8217;Keefe and The Bringers of The Projector the Perth lads (Matt Lambie, Tony Issakov and Aaron Todd). It also would&#8217;ve not been possible without the help from other people who turned up and brought stuff with them such as Eskies, Werewolf Decks and poker chips.</p>
<h3>What goes in to organising a Railscamp?</h3>
<p>A lot of time, money and effort. Preparation for this camp was being done as early as February when the venue had to be chosen. Thankfully the venue had accommodation and a very large hall, as well as offered a catering service.</p>

<p>For the servers, many a late night were spent by Bo and Ben getting them running in peak condition with all the gems, <a href='http://groups.google.com/group/railscamp/browse_thread/thread/52948763fc1114c2#'>plugins</a> and even an (outdated) copy of Wikipedia. I helped too, with converting Gitorious <a href='http://github.com/radar/scoot'>over to something more similar to Github</a>. Jack Chen also helped with SDoc which acted as our &#8220;google.com&#8221;.</p>

<p>There was also the matter of the <a href='http://groups.google.com/group/railscamp/browse_thread/thread/e5bf8a80e8261e94'>Gold Coast - Springbrook road closure</a> which happened due to a <a href='http://www.goldcoast.com.au/article/2009/04/05/66461_gold-coast-lead-story.html'>landslide which crushed the front of a car</a>.</p>

<p>Paypal epically failed <a href='http://drnicwilliams.com'>"The Doctor" Nic Williams</a> as shown by <a href='http://groups.google.com/group/railscamp/browse_thread/thread/567bccbd8128498d'>this post</a> on the google group. Eventually everything was resolved, but Paypal were jerks for putting Nic through that.</p>

<p>1st Choice at Mudgereebah was willing to do a delivery up the mountain of alcohol for a small fee, but we never used it. Instead there was a run done by myself and Oliver Barany on the Saturday afternoon.</p>

<p>There was a Ping Pong table and <a href='http://groups.google.com/group/railscamp/browse_thread/thread/a90d0ad75968f5a5'>a few people expressed interest</a> before the camp had even started.</p>

<p>Jason Crane (snapperwolf) provided the <s>drugs</s> caffeine for the campers in the form of <a href='http://groups.google.com/group/railscamp/browse_thread/thread/017f408abbf3a60e'>a couple of large bags of coffee from 5 Senses Coffee</a>, good on you Jason. Chris Herring (railsninja) supplied the grinder for the beans.</p>

<p>Bluebox group supplied free VPS hosting for a year to the value of $600 for 5 campers and Apress supplied two books &#8220;Practical Ruby Reporting&#8221; and &#8220;Linux for Mac Users&#8221;, a Railscamp first. Looking forward to their continual sponsorship.</p>
<h3>The Good</h3><pre class='markdown-html-error' style='border: solid 3px red; background-color: pink'>REXML could not parse this XML/HTML: 
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The food! There was Roast Beef, Pizza and lots more prepared by the owners of Koonjewarre and their crew!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The amount of people, perfect for the venue and the camp. Lots of people to share ideas with.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Beautiful &amp; sunny 3/4 days (4th day wasn&apos;t important, everyone left at 9). This wet/cold day turned into a week, leading to flooding in SE Queensland&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Good to see that it wasn&apos;t a completely male-dominated camp like last-year&apos;s&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Having Guitar Hero way off gave the players the opportunity to crank it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The projector screen made from paper in the Guitar Hero room&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bonfire&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ping pong table&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The uber-server which did just about everything but host Werewolf games (although I hear that&apos;s coming in v2)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Werewolf! I ran a couple of games and participated in about 1/20th as many, but loved it!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;</pre><h3>The Bad</h3><ul>
<li>Horrible over-the-phone skills from a member of staff from Gold Coast Point-to-Point. Very arrogant.</li>
<li>Getting lost in Australia Fair carpark with trolley load of BBQ stuff</li>
<li>Getting around those tables! Had to take the "long way" most of the time</li>
<li>Getting the flu from someone at the camp, having the following 2 weeks off work</li>
<li>Forgetting to bring earplugs to block out snorers (James Ottoway, Dr Nic Williams, myself)</li>
</ul><h3>The Ugly</h3><ul>
<li>Nigel Rausch</li>
</ul>
<p>See you all next time!</p>}]]></content>

   <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I have every intention of eventually doing a writeup on how my Railscamp #5 was but unfortunately I&#8217;ve come down with a flu.

I&#8217;m on meds and I&#8217;m taking a day, perhaps two, off work in order to recover. I&#8217;m also on ease-a-cold meds which aren&#8217;t helping at all.

<p>The second is this whole porn presentation argument.</p>

<p>Guess which I fear more? Yeah, the porn presentation argument. I fear that it will rip a community apart. A community that should be working together on getting past this issue and bettering themselves, not regressing to childish bickering.

   <title>How Rails Works #2: Mime Types & respond_to</title>
   <link href="http://ryanbigg.com/2009/04/how-rails-works-2-mime-types-respond_to"/>
   <updated>2009-04-25T00:00:00+10:00</updated>
   <id>http://ryanbigg.com/2009/04/how-rails-works-2-mime-types-respond_to</id>
   <content type="html"><![CDATA[<strong>THIRD COPY</strong><a href='http://github.com/radar/how-rails-works'>This guide is available on Github</a><h3>A Refresher</h3>
<p><code>respond_to</code> is a method that defines different formats that your actions, well, respond to. For those who are unfamiliar with <code>respond_to</code> or simply forgot about it, here&#8217;s a refresher.</p>

<p>Take this example:</p>
<pre class='markdown-html-error' style='border: solid 3px red; background-color: pink'>REXML could not parse this XML/HTML: 
&lt;pre&gt;
class BlogsController &lt; ApplicationController
  def index
    @blogs = Blog.all(:limit =&gt; 10)
    respond_to do |format|
      format.html
      format.xml
    end
  end
end
&lt;/pre&gt;</pre>
<p>It&#8217;s an index action in a controller called <code>BlogsController</code> and we have a collection of <code>Blog</code> objects stored in <code>@blogs</code>. We then call <code>respond_to</code> and specify the block with a single argument of <code>format</code>. On <code>format</code> we call <code>html</code> and <code>xml</code> which will render <em>app/views/blogs/index.html.erb</em> and <em>app/views/blogs/index.xml.erb</em> respectively. In those templates we can iterate over the <code>@blogs</code> collection and do whatever with it that we fancy. There&#8217;s a shorter way to write the <code>respond_to</code> for this:</p>
<pre>
respond_to :html, :xml
</pre>
<p>If we want some formats to respond one way, and some others to respond another way we can do this:</p>
<pre>
respond_to do |format|
  format.html { @blogs = Blog.all(:limit => 10) }
  format.any(:atom, :rss) { @blogs = Blog.all }
end
</pre>
<p>In this example <em>index.html.erb</em>&#8217;s <code>@blogs</code> will contain 10 objects, where <em>index.atom.erb</em>&#8217;s and <em>index.rss.erb</em>&#8217;s <code>@blogs</code> will contain all the blogs record.</p>
<h3>Diving In</h3>
<p>My first post in this series was my Timezone Overview for Rails 2.2. Today I would like to cover how mime types and <code>respond_to</code> work in Rails 2.3. The reason I choose both of these instead of just <code>respond_to</code> is because they tie in close together.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve tried to make all the methods in this guide clickable with links to the source on Github.</p>

<p>Firstly I&#8217;ll talk about <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIME_type'>MIME types</a> in Rails.</p>

<p>The default MIME types are loaded when Rails starts up by <a href='http://github.com/rails/rails/blob/35c5727acea882f4cef2a8a2d12d87a8fda045c8/actionpack/lib/action_controller/mime_type.rb#L212'>the final line in <em>actionpack/lib/action_controller/mime_type.rb</em></a>:</p>
<pre>
require 'action_controller/mime_types'
</pre>
<p>This loads the <em><a href='http://github.com/rails/rails/blob/35c5727acea882f4cef2a8a2d12d87a8fda045c8/actionpack/lib/action_controller/mime_types.rb#L4-21'>actionpack/lib/action_controller/mime_types.rb</a></em> file and registers the default MIME types:</p>
<pre>
Mime::Type.register "*/*", :all
Mime::Type.register "text/plain", :text, [], %w(txt)
Mime::Type.register "text/html", :html, %w( application/xhtml+xml ), %w( xhtml )
Mime::Type.register "text/javascript", :js, %w( application/javascript application/x-javascript )
Mime::Type.register "text/css", :css
Mime::Type.register "text/calendar", :ics
Mime::Type.register "text/csv", :csv
Mime::Type.register "application/xml", :xml, %w( text/xml application/x-xml )
Mime::Type.register "application/rss+xml", :rss
Mime::Type.register "application/atom+xml", :atom
Mime::Type.register "application/x-yaml", :yaml, %w( text/yaml )

Mime::Type.register "multipart/form-data", :multipart_form
Mime::Type.register "application/x-www-form-urlencoded", :url_encoded_form

# http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4627.txt
# http://www.json.org/JSONRequest.html
Mime::Type.register "application/json", :json, %w( text/x-json application/jsonrequest )  
</pre>
<p>You may recognise the syntax used in <em>mime_types.rb</em> from your app&#8217;s <em>config/initializers/mime_types.rb</em>. This file is used to define new MIME types for your application and is loaded on initialization of your application by <a href='http://github.com/rails/rails/blob/35c5727acea882f4cef2a8a2d12d87a8fda045c8/railties/lib/initializer.rb#L174'>this line in initializer.rb</a></p>
<pre>load_application_initializers</pre>
<p>and <a href='http://github.com/rails/rails/blob/35c5727acea882f4cef2a8a2d12d87a8fda045c8/railties/lib/initializer.rb#L597-603'>the corresponding `load_application_initializers` method</a>:</p>
<pre>
def load_application_initializers
  if gems_dependencies_loaded
    Dir["#{configuration.root_path}/config/initializers/**/*.rb"].sort.each do |initializer|
      load(initializer)
    end
  end
end
</pre>
<p>which is responsible for loading all your application&#8217;s initializers, including <em>config/initializers/mime_types.rb</em>.</p>

<p>The MIME types defined by Rails and your initializers are the methods that you call on the block object <code>format</code> or the symbols that you pass to respond_to. You may recognise these from the symbols passed to the <code>Mime::Type.register</code> calls earlier.</p>
<a href='http://github.com/rails/rails/blob/35c5727acea882f4cef2a8a2d12d87a8fda045c8/actionpack/lib/action_controller/mime_responds.rb#L102-109'>`respond_to`</a><pre>
def respond_to(*types, &amp;block)
  raise ArgumentError, "respond_to takes either types or a block, never both" unless types.any? ^ block
  block ||= lambda { |responder| types.each { |type| responder.send(type) } }
  responder = Responder.new(self)
  block.call(responder)
  responder.respond
end
</pre>
<p>If we use the block syntax this will just <code>call</code> the <code>block</code> object with the argument of <code>responder</code> which is defined as <code>Responder.new</code>.</p>

<p>If we use the single line syntax. this will just pass in the types as an array. This method then defines a <code>lambda</code> which is a <code>Proc</code> object just like a usual block. This takes one argument, called <code>responder</code> and then calls the types on the responder object.</p>

<p>The <code>||=</code> on the block definition means &#8220;set this variable only if it hasn&#8217;t been set already&#8221;. The next line is defining the <code>responder</code> object which triggers <a href='http://github.com/rails/rails/blob/35c5727acea882f4cef2a8a2d12d87a8fda045c8/actionpack/lib/action_controller/mime_responds.rb#L102-109'>`initialize` method for `Responder`</a>:</p>
<pre>
class Responder
  def initialize(controller)
    @controller = controller
    @request    = controller.request
    @response   = controller.response
  
    if ActionController::Base.use_accept_header
      @mime_type_priority = Array(Mime::Type.lookup_by_extension(@request.parameters[:format]) || @request.accepts)
    else
      @mime_type_priority = [@request.format]
    end

    @order     = []
    @responses = {}
  end
  ...
end
</pre>
<p>This defines a couple of key variables, namely <code>@mime_type_priority</code> and <code>@responses</code>.</p>

<p>The first, <code>@mime_type_priorty</code> calls <a href='http://github.com/rails/rails/blob/a2270ef2594b97891994848138614657363f2806/actionpack/lib/action_controller/mime_type.rb#L69-71'>`Mime::Type.lookup_by_extension(@request.parameters[:format])`</a> which looks like:</p>
<pre>
def lookup_by_extension(extension)
  EXTENSION_LOOKUP[extension]
end
</pre>
<p><code>EXTENSION_LOOKUP</code> is <a href='http://github.com/rails/rails/blob/a2270ef2594b97891994848138614657363f2806/actionpack/lib/action_controller/mime_type.rb#L5'>defined on line #5 of mime_type.rb</a> as a hash:</p>
<pre>
EXTENSION_LOOKUP = Hash.new { |h, k| h[k] = Type.new(k) unless k.blank? }
</pre>
<p>What happens when a key is looked for on this hash it calls <code>Mime::Type.new(key)</code> which calls the <a href='http://github.com/rails/rails/blob/a2270ef2594b97891994848138614657363f2806/actionpack/lib/action_controller/mime_type.rb#L147-150'>`initialize`</a> method for <code>Mime::Type</code>:</p>
<pre>
def initialize(string, symbol = nil, synonyms = [])
  @symbol, @synonyms = symbol, synonyms
   @string = string
end
</pre>
<p>We eventually understand that all our original <code>@mime_type_priority</code> is simply a <code>Mime::Type</code> object. If we requested HTML, the MIME type would be: <code>#&amp;lt;Mime::Type:0x2624380 @synonyms=[&quot;application/xhtml+xml&quot;], @symbol=:html, @string=&quot;text/html&quot;&amp;gt;</code>. This element is made into an array and then used in the <code>respond</code> method.</p>

<p>The second variable, <code>@responses</code> is defined as an empty hash. The magic happens in the <code>respond</code> method:</p>
<pre>
def respond
  for priority in @mime_type_priority
    if priority == Mime::ALL
      @responses[@order.first].call
      return
    else
      if @responses[priority]
        @responses[priority].call
        return # mime type match found, be happy and return
      end
    end
  end

  if @order.include?(Mime::ALL)
    @responses[Mime::ALL].call
  else
    @controller.send :head, :not_acceptable
  end
end
</pre>
<p>This method iterates over <code>@mime_type_priority</code> and then checks firstly if the element is a <code>Mime::ALL</code> This can be achieved by making the format of the URL &#8220;all&#8221;, such as <em>http://localhost:3000/blogs.all</em>. If the element is not <code>Mime::ALL</code> this continues iterating through until it finds a format that is defined. It does this by checking if there is a key in the <code>@responses</code> hash&#8230; but it&#8217;s empty. So I first thought, too. <a href='http://github.com/rails/rails/blob/35c5727acea882f4cef2a8a2d12d87a8fda045c8/actionpack/lib/action_controller/mime_responds.rb#L157-159'>Buried just over halfway is this method</a> which is called when the file is loaded and this calls <a href='http://github.com/rails/rails/blob/35c5727acea882f4cef2a8a2d12d87a8fda045c8/actionpack/lib/action_controller/mime_responds.rb#L147-155'>`generate_method_for_mime`</a> which does some funky <code>class_eval</code>&#8216;ing:</p>
<pre>
def self.generate_method_for_mime(mime)
  sym = mime.is_a?(Symbol) ? mime : mime.to_sym
  const = sym.to_s.upcase
  class_eval &lt;&lt;-RUBY, __FILE__, __LINE__ + 1
    def #{sym}(&amp;block)                # def html(&amp;block)
      custom(Mime::#{const}, &amp;block)  #   custom(Mime::HTML, &amp;block)
    end                               # end
  RUBY
end
</pre>
<p>Remember back when we were calling <code>responder.send(type)</code>? This is what it calls, this generated method.</p>

<p>The generated methods take an optional block, as shown by the code for <a href='http://github.com/rails/rails/blob/35c5727acea882f4cef2a8a2d12d87a8fda045c8/actionpack/lib/action_controller/mime_responds.rb#L127-137'>`custom`</a>:</p>
<pre>
def custom(mime_type, &amp;block)
  mime_type = mime_type.is_a?(Mime::Type) ? mime_type : Mime::Type.lookup(mime_type.to_s)

  @order &lt;&lt; mime_type

  @responses[mime_type] ||= Proc.new do
    @response.template.template_format = mime_type.to_sym
    @response.content_type = mime_type.to_s
    block_given? ? block.call : @controller.send(:render, :action => @controller.action_name)
  end
end
</pre>
<p>If the first argument given to custom is not a <code>Mime::Type</code> object then it will do a lookup and find it. The method will then concatenate into <code>@order</code> <code>mime_type</code>. This variable is used for when <code>Mime::ALL</code> is specified as the mime type, it will use the first one in this list, which will be the first one you&#8217;ve called in your <code>respond_to</code>. If you&#8217;ve define your respond_to like this:</p>
<pre>
def index
  @blogs = Blog.all(:limit => 10)
  respond_to do |format|
    format.html 
    format.json { render :json => @blogs }
    format.any(:atom, :xml) { @blogs = Blog.all }
  end
end
</pre>
<p>The <code>all</code> will call <code>html</code> because it was defined first. Following on with this example, the <code>format.html</code> method isn&#8217;t passed a block, but the <code>format.xml</code> is. This determines what this line does in <code>custom</code>:</p>
<pre>
block_given? ? block.call : @controller.send(:render, :action => @controller.action_name)
</pre>
<p>When we don&#8217;t pass a block for the <code>format.html</code> it will render the action, looking for <em>index.html.erb</em> which, in the default scaffold, will list all the blogs. Rails does this by calling:</p>
<pre>
@controller.send(:render, :action => @controller.action_name)
</pre>
<p>It calls <code>send</code> because <code>render</code> is a protected method. This passes a single argument to render, <code>{ :action =&gt; @controller.action_name }</code> which in this example is &#8220;index&#8221;. <a href='>http://github.com/rails/rails/blob/a2270ef2594b97891994848138614657363f2806/actionpack/lib/action_controller/base.rb#L859-946'>`render` is a pretty heavy method</a>, weighing in at close to 100 lines, so I won&#8217;t bore you with all the details of this method in this post. What I will show you is the part where it processes our <a href='http://github.com/rails/rails/blob/a2270ef2594b97891994848138614657363f2806/actionpack/lib/action_controller/base.rb#L907-908'>`:action`</a> option:</p>
<pre>
elsif action_name = options[:action]
  render_for_file(default_template(action_name.to_s), options[:status], layout)
</pre>
<p>The method we&#8217;re interested here is not <code>render_for_file</code> but <a href='http://github.com/rails/rails/blob/a2270ef2594b97891994848138614657363f2806/actionpack/lib/action_controller/base.rb#L1318-1320'>`default_template`</a>:</p>
<pre>
def default_template(action_name = self.action_name)
  self.view_paths.find_template(default_template_name(action_name), default_template_format)
end
</pre>
<p>This calls a number of methods, but what we&#8217;re interested in here firsty is the <a href='http://github.com/rails/rails/blob/a2270ef2594b97891994848138614657363f2806/actionpack/lib/action_controller/layout.rb#L276-278'>`default_template_format`</a> method. This method looks like this:</p>
<pre>
def default_template_format
  response.template.template_format
end
</pre>
<p>and <a href='http://github.com/rails/rails/blob/a2270ef2594b97891994848138614657363f2806/actionpack/lib/action_view/base.rb#L265-273'>`template_format`</a> looks like:</p>
<pre>
def template_format
  if defined? @template_format
    @template_format
  elsif controller &amp;&amp; controller.respond_to?(:request)
    @template_format = controller.request.template_format.to_sym
  else
    @template_format = :html
  end
end
</pre>
<p>Our request will match the <a href='http://github.com/rails/rails/blob/a2270ef2594b97891994848138614657363f2806/actionpack/lib/action_view/base.rb#L268-269'>`elsif`</a> in this code which will call another <a href='http://github.com/rails/rails/blob/a2270ef2594b97891994848138614657363f2806/actionpack/lib/action_controller/request.rb#L193-203'>`template_format`</a> method, this time on the <code>request</code> object of our controller. This method looks like this:</p>
<pre>
def template_format
  parameter_format = parameters[:format]
  if parameter_format
    parameter_format
  elsif xhr?
    :js
  else
    :html
  end
end
</pre>
<p>Yes! After all this time it does call <code>parameters[:format]</code>! This is also known as <code>params[:format]</code> and, to the well trained <code>&quot;html&quot;</code>. So way back in our initial <code>default_template</code> call:</p>
<pre>
def default_template(action_name = self.action_name)
  self.view_paths.find_template(default_template_name(action_name), default_template_format)
end
</pre>
<p>We were firstly interested in <code>default_template_format</code> which is what we just covered. Now we&#8217;re interested in <a href='http://github.com/rails/rails/blob/35c5727acea882f4cef2a8a2d12d87a8fda045c8/actionpack/lib/action_view/paths.rb#L43-67'>`find_template`</a>:</p>
<pre>
def find_template(original_template_path, format = nil, html_fallback = true)
  return original_template_path if original_template_path.respond_to?(:render)
  template_path = original_template_path.sub(/^\//, '')

  each do |load_path|
    if format &amp;&amp; (template = load_path["#{template_path}.#{I18n.locale}.#{format}"])
      return template
    elsif format &amp;&amp; (template = load_path["#{template_path}.#{format}"])
      return template
    elsif template = load_path["#{template_path}.#{I18n.locale}"]
      return template
    elsif template = load_path[template_path]
      return template
    # Try to find html version if the format is javascript
    elsif format == :js &amp;&amp; html_fallback &amp;&amp; template = load_path["#{template_path}.#{I18n.locale}.html"]
      return template
    elsif format == :js &amp;&amp; html_fallback &amp;&amp; template = load_path["#{template_path}.html"]
      return template
    end
  end

  return Template.new(original_template_path) if File.file?(original_template_path)

  raise MissingTemplate.new(self, original_template_path, format)
end
</pre>
<p>Nothing inside the <code>each</code> block will match, so it will not return anything. Instead, what is returned is the line after the each block:</p>
<pre>
  return Template.new(original_template_path) if File.file?(original_template_path)
</pre>
<p>This returns a Template object like this:</p>
<pre>
#&lt;ActionView::Template:0x2193258 @format=nil, @base_path=nil, @template_path="blogs/", @extension=nil, @locale=nil, @name=nil, @load_path=nil&gt;
</pre><a href='http://github.com/rails/rails/blob/8fa4275a72c334fe945dada6113fa0153ca28c87/actionpack/lib/action_controller/base.rb#L1239-1243'>`render_for_file`</a>
<p>When we do pass a block to our <code>format.xml</code>, this is much simpler in the call to <a href='http://github.com/rails/rails/blob/8fa4275a72c334fe945dada6113fa0153ca28c87/actionpack/lib/action_controller/base.rb#L945-947'>`render`</a>:</p>
<pre>
elsif xml = options[:xml]
  response.content_type ||= Mime::XML
  render_for_text(xml.respond_to?(:to_xml) ? xml.to_xml : xml, options[:status])
end
</pre>
<p>This code calls <a href='http://github.com/rails/rails/blob/dd2ed32418a74ca9126834f98a1b0bca926c0c4f/activerecord/lib/active_record/serializers/xml_serializer.rb#L154-157'>`to_xml`</a> on our collection and converts it to an XML document.</p>

<p>Finally, the <a href='http://github.com/rails/rails/blob/4b68debb1c4d3d272b237049c88d01b1eceb58f0/actionpack/lib/action_controller/mime_responds.rb#L139-145'>`any`</a> is another method defined on the <code>Responder</code> object. You can pass to this a collection of mime types and for these mime types it will perform the block. In this example we&#8217;ve used:</p>
<pre lang='rails'>
  format.any(:atom, :xml) { @blogs = Blog.all }
</pre>
<p>but you can also do:</p>
<pre lang='rails'>
  format.any { @blogs = Blog.all }
</pre>
<p>which will define the response for all currently undefined mime types.</p>

<p><code>any</code> goes a bit like this:</p>
<pre lang='rails'>
def any(*args, &amp;block)
  if args.any?
    args.each { |type| send(type, &amp;block) }
  else
    custom(@mime_type_priority.first, &amp;block)
  end
end 
</pre>
<p>We&#8217;ve passed args to ours, so it&#8217;ll just call the methods <code>atom</code> and <code>xml</code> on the <code>Responder</code> object and then render the appropriate views for these.</p>

<p>If we don&#8217;t pass arguments to <code>any</code>, any MIME type that we don&#8217;t have a <code>respond_to</code> line for will call the <code>any</code> block instead. Take for example, if we had this:</p>
<pre>
def index
  @blogs = Blog.all(:limit => 10)
  respond_to do |format|
    format.html 
    format.json { render :json => @blogs }
    format.any { @blogs = Blog.all }
  end
end
</pre>
<p>And we requested an XML page, http://localhost:3000/blogs.xml, this will trigger the code in the <code>any</code> block to be ran.</p>

<p>So that wraps up this guide on respond_to. Thanks for reading!</p>}]]></content>

   <title>Pretty-ifying URLs</title>
   <link href="http://ryanbigg.com/2009/04/pretty-ifying-urls"/>
   <updated>2009-04-18T00:00:00+10:00</updated>
   <id>http://ryanbigg.com/2009/04/pretty-ifying-urls</id>
   <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In today&#8217;s modern world we are not limited (cough, FORTRAN) to storing information in just a couple of bits. Some say that having pretty URLs is good SEO. I say it&#8217;s just common sense. I want the URL to tell a story, not give me some number that is only important to the system it&#8217;s coming from.</p>

<p>This is where <code>to_param</code> comes in.</p>

<p>By default this is defined like this:</p>
<pre lang='ruby'>
def to_param
  id
end
</pre>
<p>Pretty high-tech stuff there. I won&#8217;t explain it to you. Give it a moment to sink it. et-cetera. This method is called on an object when it is passed to a url helper such as <code>link_to</code> or <code>redirect_to</code>. It is important to note that you should NEVER call <code>@object.id</code> as that will give the id of the object, not the <code>to_param</code> version of that name.</p>

<p>You can override this in your model in order to give you pretty urls! The way you do this is:</p>
<pre lang='rails'>
def to_param
  "#{id}-#{name.parameterize}"
end
</pre>
<p>Where <code>id</code> is the id of the model and <code>name</code> is the text you want into the URL. We call <code>parameterize</code> on this text in order to make it URL friendly.</p>

<p>The reason why we put in the id in the URL is two-fold. Firstly, (<em>/forums/1-best-forum-ever</em>) is so that when it gets passed to our controller as <code>params[:id]</code> or similar, we&#8217;re able to pass it to a finder:</p>
<pre lang='rails'>
Forum.find(params[:id])
# will be passed in as...
Forum.find("1-best-forum-ever")
</pre>
<p>Now you may go &#8220;Hey&#8230; wait a second! I don&#8217;t have an ID in my database that says &#8216;1-best-forum-ever&#8217;!&#8221; and you&#8217;d be right, you don&#8217;t. But you <strong>do</strong> have an ID of 1 for a record somewhere. Rails will call <code>to_i</code> on this value and convert it simply down to <code>1</code> and you&#8217;ll be able to treat the pretty URL as if it were a real ID.</p>

<p>Secondly, if two objects in your database have the same name they won&#8217;t clash for the parameterized versions, since the id will always be unique.</p>
<h3>But I don't want my ID in my URL</h3>
<p>Hey, that&#8217;s cool too! Just a little tougher&#8230; Before you save your records you&#8217;ll want to write out the permalink as a new field, so define a field called <code>permalink</code> in your table if you want to take this route. Then you do a <code>before_save</code> and define <code>to_param</code> like this:</p>
<pre lang='rails'>
before_create :set_permalink

def set_permalink
  self.permalink = name.parameterize
end

def to_param
  permalink
end
</pre>
<p>Now when you call the finder you&#8217;re going to need to <code>find_by_permalink!</code> instead of just <code>find</code>:</p>
<pre lang='rails'>
Forum.find_by_permalink!(params[:id])
</pre>
<p>We have to use the bang version of <code>find_by_permalink</code> because this will raise an <code>ActiveRecord::RecordNotFound</code> exception if the record is not found, just like <code>find</code>. (Thanks to <a href='http://frozenplague.net/2009/04/pretty-ifying-urls/comment-page-1/#comment-10583'>Yarsolav Markin</a> for mentioning this)</p>

<p>So there you have it. <code>to_param</code> overriding for pretty URLs.</p>}]]></content>

   <updated>2009-04-02T00:00:00+10:00</updated>
   <id>http://ryanbigg.com/2009/04/testing-gems-with-multiruby</id>
   <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A couple of days ago I was requested politely and with acknowledgement of my humanity, by <a href='http://drnicwilliams.com'>Dr Nic</a> to write a post about testing gems on 1.9 and because he&#8217;s my boss I&#8217;m obliged to do the things he tells me to do. He told me to read his post about <a href='http://drnicwilliams.com/2008/12/11/future-proofing-your-ruby-code/'>Future-proofing Your Ruby Code</a> and in particular the instructions about installing multiruby.</p>
<h3>How to install multiruby</h3>
<p>You can install multiruby, different versions of ruby, rubygems and useful gems using these commands:</p>
<pre>
sudo gem install ZenTest
multiruby_setup mri:svn:tag:v1_8_6_114
multiruby_setup mri:svn:tag:v1_8_7_153
multiruby_setup mri:svn:tag:v1_9_1_0

multiruby_setup update:rubygems
multiruby -S gem install --no-ri --no-rdoc --development test-unit</pre>
<p>This will:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Install ZenTest (or the latest version)</li>
  <li>Install Ruby 1.8.6, build 114</li>
  <li>Install Ruby 1.8.7, build 153</li>
  <li>Install Ruby 1.9.1, build 0</li>
  <li>Setup Rubygems for all three versions and;</li>
  <li>install test-unit for all three versions!</li>
</ol>
<p>You may also want to <span class='term'>multiruby -S gem install --no-ri --no-rdoc --development rails mocha rspec</span>.</p>

<p>multiruby is awesome because it sticks this all in your home directory in a folder called <em>.multiruby</em>, so don&#8217;t worry about it clashing with your existing version(s) of ruby. Different versions go in different directories inside <em>.multiruby/versions</em>.</p>
<h3>numero!</h3>
<p>Today we&#8217;re going to be testing a gem that <a href='http://frozenplague.net/numero.html'>I recently made use of on this site</a>. For those of you that visited <a href='http://frozenplague.net/numero.html'>the site yesterday</a> you would&#8217;ve seen something like this:</p>
<pre>
  112.117.116.115.32.34.104.101.108.108.111.32.119.111.114.108.100.34
</pre>
<p>This is numero! <small>(exclamation mark <strong>compulsory</strong>)</small>. I don&#8217;t know where the idea came from. According to the MSN logs I keep, at 8:03am Friday morning I went and made breakfast and then at 8:13am I had the idea. But it&#8217;s awesome. The &#8220;language&#8221; uses the ASCII representation of all your favourite characters and separates them using a dot. This is numero! script. You run it using the numero! gem. This is how you get it:</p>
<pre>
sudo gem install radar-numero --source http://gems.github.com
</pre>
<p>Test it out by running it on your favourite ruby script!</p>
<pre>
numero favourite.rb
</pre>
<p>This will generate a file called <em>favourite.numero</em> and then evaluate the newly generated numero! code. Now you can throw away your ugly ruby file and bathe in the glory that is numero by then running:</p>
<pre>
numero favourite.numero
</pre>
<p>So it appears we&#8217;ve gone off on a tangent here! Fear not! For I want you to test my gem on your new multiruby setup:</p>
<pre>
git clone git://github.com/radar/numero
cd numero
git checkout -b broken origin/broken
</pre>
<p>Now this sensible naming schema will probably dissolve the mystery surrounding what&#8217;s going to happen next. You&#8217;re going to be testing my gem, and it&#8217;s going to break.</p>
<h3>Testing numero!</h3>
<p>When I wrote this particular branch of numero!, I used <span class='term'>"a"[0]</span> to get the ASCII representation (97) of the letter a. Generally, I would&#8217;ve used use a variable rather than &#8220;a&#8221;, but this is just an example. The problem is that this doesn&#8217;t work the same way in Ruby 1.8.* and Ruby 1.9. If we run <span class='term'>multiruby -S test/test_numero.rb</span> we see that it passes on both versions of Ruby 1.8, but fails on Ruby 1.9!</p>
<strong>Ruby 1.8.*</strong><pre>
Loaded suite test/test_numero
Started
.
Finished in 0.001186 seconds.

1 tests, 1 assertions, 0 failures, 0 errors
</pre><strong>Ruby 1.9</strong>
<p>Loaded suite test/test_numero Started F</p>

<p>Finished in 0.025228 seconds.</p>

<p>1) Failure: test_numero_compiles(TestNumero) <span>test/test_numero.rb:9</span>: &lt;&#8221;<span>&#34;p.u.t.s. .\&#34;.h.e.l.l.o. .w.o.r.l.d.\&#34;&#34;</span>&#8221;&gt; expected but was &lt;&#8221;112.117.116.115.32.34.104.101.108.108.111.32.119.111.114.108.100.34&#8221;&gt;.</p>

<p>1 tests, 1 assertions, 1 failures, 0 errors, 0 pendings, 0 omissions, 0 notifications &lt;/pre&gt;</p>

<p>Not good! <strong>This is something I wouldn't have found if I didn't test the functionality on multiple Rubies.</strong> Using multiruby is <strong>essential</strong> to ensure that your code works for everybody. We don&#8217;t want to end up like Internet Explorer.</p>

<p>The solution, of course, is to use <span class='term'>str.unpack("C").first</span> instead. You have two options: 1) change the code yourself in <em>lib/numero.rb</em> to use the afore-mentioned example or 2) <span class='term'>git checkout master</span>. Now we run the tests again and now Ruby 1.9 passes:</p>
<strong>Ruby 1.8.7</strong><pre>
Finished in 0.001109 seconds.

1 tests, 1 assertions, 0 failures, 0 errors
</pre><strong>Ruby 1.9.1</strong><pre>

   <title>Logga is now Helpa</title>

   <updated>2009-03-14T00:00:00+10:00</updated>
   <id>http://ryanbigg.com/2009/03/logga-is-now-helpa</id>
   <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A few months ago I got in contact with Adam Thorsen who owns the http://loglibrary.com domain. He used to host the log files for the #rubyonrails channel on it, but stopped doing due to lack of time / whatever. So I wrote a bot over a couple of weekends and a parser (<a href='http://github.com/radar/logga-parser'>later written in python</a>) for the logs from <a href='http://thesaq.com/rubyonrails'>radsaq's logs</a>. This was hosted through Adam&#8217;s contacts at EngineYard. EngineYard&#8217;s hosting was solid as and whenever there was an error they would contact us explaining what it was and how to fix it.</p>

<p>This all worked perfectly up until about a month ago when I started to receive &#8220;threats&#8221; that due to the global economic catastrophuck (<a href='http://elevensoft.com'>thanks to Andy Wright for that word</a>) I would have to start paying for the hosting on the EngineYard service. Also, the site I made for it wasn&#8217;t receiving a high enough volume. I have too many side projects (rboard, lookup and Ruby 1.9 compatibility to name a few) that I need to get rid of some. This is one of them. If someone else would like to take over the logging and site part of &#8220;logga&#8221; I would be more than happy to hand this over. From today until further notice I will be hosting the bot in &#8220;helpa&#8221;-mode on my slicehost until someone else steps up. Thanks for your support for this project.</p>}]]></content>

   <title>A Call to Action</title>
   <link href="http://ryanbigg.com/2009/03/a-call-to-action"/>
   <updated>2009-03-06T00:00:00+10:00</updated>
   <id>http://ryanbigg.com/2009/03/a-call-to-action</id>
   <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today marks 34 days since I wrote my post on Ruby 1.9.1. That has been the single most successful piece I have ever written and I&#8217;d like to thank those people who linked to it and those who have commented on it.</p>

<p>Now I must ask something of the community. We have this wonderful new version of Ruby to use and yet many of the gems we love to use are still broken. Why? Because the owners of the gems are lazy or simply cannot be bothered or do not want to spend the time to alter their gems to make them compatible with Ruby 1.9.<em>. There have been a few authors out there <a href='http://github.com/FooBarWidget/passenger/commit/0e43297b18f03e8b01c7c40897925b2ede6bc831'>such as the Phusion Passenger guys</a> (look how small that commit is!) who have added 1.9 compatibility to their gem and this is a show of how important they think the community is to the success of their product. They</em>want* the community to use 1.9 with their gem.</p>

<p>This is a call to action for those developers who have failed to release a 1.9 compatible version of their gem for some reason. There is no excuse. If you can&#8217;t do it, get someone else to do it. There&#8217;s this awesome service called <a href='http://github.com'>github</a> which is really handy when you want to share a project with the world and get people to submit stuff. If you don&#8217;t want to fix your gem, then fine. Other people will, in time. Hell, even I might fire up a few new repositories when things settle down with 1.9 compatibility for <strong>your</strong> hard work (and of course attempt to get my changes put back into mainstream). Who knows, I might even find fame through this!</p>

<p>Please, please, please! Update your gems. It&#8217;s not that hard and it&#8217;s setting the Ruby community on the path to full compatibility with 1.9. We don&#8217;t want to become like Internet Explorer.</p>}]]></content>

   <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today when I upgraded to Safari 4 (beta) and after the <a href='http://twitter.com/radarlistener/status/1246809563'>two updates</a> I installed, I tried launching Mail but it crashed with a &#8220;This application quit unexpectedly&#8221;, then it went on to blame the GrowlMail plugin. To fix this, I found <a href='http://forums.macrumors.com/showpost.php?s=1c0aaccd5981f5f3c7278b161310cb59&p=7160713&postcount=10'>this forum post on MacRumors</a>. TheReason actually means to go into <em>~/Library/Mail/Bundles</em> and remove <em>GrowlMail.mailbundle</em>.</p>

<p>This is a temporary fix as this (obviously) disables GrowlMail, but Mail launches. If you can put up with not receiving growl notifications every time you receive a notification you&#8217;ve won a lottery you didn&#8217;t enter, then go for it.</p>

   <title>Ruby 1.9.1 & Friends</title>
   <link href="http://ryanbigg.com/2009/01/ruby-191-rubygems-rails"/>
   <updated>2009-01-31T00:00:00+10:00</updated>
   <id>http://ryanbigg.com/2009/01/ruby-191-rubygems-rails</id>
   <content type="html"><![CDATA[<strong>I have <a href='http://ryanbigg.com/2009/12/ruby-1-9-1-friends-11-months-on/'>made a followup post</a>to this which contains more up-to-date information. This post is left here as an example of the state of Ruby 1.9 in January-July 2009.</strong><strong>Last updated: July 11th, 2009</strong><a href='http://eigenclass.org/hiki/Changes+in+Ruby+1.9'>For changes between Ruby 1.8 and Ruby 1.9, look here</a>
<p>So this morning I sat down to give Ruby 1.9.1 a shot with my goal being to get at least the very, very basic Rails application running on it. I&#8217;ve run this guide on Mac OS X. Your mileage may vary.</p>
<h2>Ruby 1.9.1</h2>
<p>Download it from the <a href='http://ruby-lang.org'>ruby-lang.org website</a>, install it using <pre class='markdown-html-error' style='border: solid 3px red; background-color: pink'>REXML could not parse this XML/HTML: 
&lt;span class=&apos;term&apos;&gt;autoconf &amp;&amp; ./configure --with-readline-dir=/usr/local --program-suffix=1.9 &amp;&amp; make &amp;&amp; sudo make install&lt;/span&gt;</pre> and everything should be peachy. I&#8217;ve gone about installing Ruby 1.9.1 alongside my current installation of Ruby. If you wish to go the &#8220;whole hog&#8221; (and I don&#8217;t recommend that you do, unless you know how to revert it) don&#8217;t run the configure command with the <span class='term'>--program-suffix</span> option specified.</p>
<h2>Rubygems</h2>
<p>Since <a href='http://ryanbigg.com/2009/01/ruby-191-rubygems-rails/#comment-7575'>Ruby 1.9.1 comes with Rubygems now</a>, and this has been confirmed to Just Work (tm). The command used was <span class='term'>gem1.9</span>.</p>
<h2>Rails</h2><span class='term'>gem1.9 install rails rack sqlite3-ruby</span><ul>
  <li>Rails: 2.3.2</li>
  <li>Rack: 1.0.0</li>
  <li>Sqlite3 Ruby: 1.2.4</li>
</ul>
<p>You need the rack gem for running your Rails app and of course the sqlite3-ruby gem because, by default, Rails applications use sqlite3.</p>
<h2>The Rails App</h2>
<p>We&#8217;ll generate a Rails application by typing <span class='term'>rails onepointnine</span> and we&#8217;ll head into this directory.</p>

<p>Because I&#8217;ve installed 1.9.1 alongside 1.8, the version that Rails will try to use by default is 1.8. To fix this, we&#8217;ll be running our commands with a <span class='term'>ruby1.9</span> prefix.</p>

<p>We launch our server by <span class='term'>ruby1.9 script/server</span> and then go to <a href='http://localhost:3000'>http://localhost:3000</a>. Welcome aboard! Clicking on &#8220;About your application&#8217;s environment&#8221; should give you something like <a href='http://skitch.com/radarlistener/baeqh/ruby1.9-rails2.3.2'>this</a>. If you don&#8217;t see Ruby 1.9.1, you&#8217;re using the wrong version of Ruby. Ensure that you launched the server with <span class='term'>ruby 1.9 script/server</span></p>

<p>In another tab, we run <span class='term'>ruby1.9 script/generate scaffold blog title:string text:text</span> to get our scaffold and <span class='term'>rake1.9 db:migrate</span> to put some tables in our sqlite3 database. Now go to <a href='http://localhost:3000/blogs'>http://localhost:3000/blogs</a> and play around a bit. Everything at this point should be working.</p>
<!--more--><h2>Tests</h2>
<p>So now I&#8217;ll try a <a href='http://github.com/radar/rboard'>real app</a>, rBoard.</p>

<p>Upon trying to run <span class='term'>rake1.9 spec</span> it gives:</p>
<pre class='markdown-html-error' style='border: solid 3px red; background-color: pink'>REXML could not parse this XML/HTML:

<p>I&#8217;m serious. Go figure.</p>

<p>Annotated the output a little bit. This just tells us we&#8217;re missing <span class='term'>test-unit</span>, version 1.2.3. Usually we would go ahead and do <span class='term'>sudo gem1.9 install test-unit</span>, but this installs 2.0.2! Never fear, just a quick edit of <em>lib/tasks/rspec.rake</em>&#8217;s first line and we&#8217;re off and racing.</p>
<h2>Misbehaving Gems</h2><a name='gem_solution'>&nbsp;</a>
<p>Generally gems will not install because they are using functions in Ruby that no longer exist. Upon suggestion from the first comment on this blog post and from <a href='http://writequit.org/blog/?p=247&cpage=1#comment-442'>another blog on the interwebs</a> I replace occurrences of<span class='term'>RARRAY(blah)->ptr</span> with <span class='term'>RARRAYPTR(blah)</span>, <span class='term'>RARRAY(blah)->len</span> with <span class='term'>RARRAYLEN(blah)</span>, and commented out all the places where it said <span class='term'>rb_thread_start_timer()</span> and <span class='term'>rb_thread_stop_timer()</span> and this generally fixes the gem so I can install it.</p>
<h3>MySQL</h3>
<p>To install mysql I first attempted <span class='term'>gem1.9 install mysql</span> (for Mac OS X, you need to specify additional parameters for this command: <span class='term'>-- --with-mysql-dir=/usr/local/mysql --with-mysql-lib=/usr/local/mysql/lib  --with-mysql-include=/usr/local/mysql/include</span>) and it failed epically:</p>

<p>The <a href='#gem_solution'>solution above</a> fixes this problem, also using <a href='http://github.com/radar/mysql'>my own fixed version of the gem</a> works too, but throws an error when trying to install the documentation. Just use <span class='term'>--no-ri --no-rdoc</span> options until this is fixed.</p>
<h3>Hpricot</h3>
<p>Once upon a time reported as a failing gem, now passes! Good work!</p>
<h3>pg (postgresql gem)</h3>

<p>Mac users apparently do not need to install ruby-xslt. Everyone else is not so lucky.</p>

<p>To install this on Ubuntu, we first need to do this: <span class='term'>sudo apt-get install libxml-ruby1.8 libxslt1-dev</span> and then we do <span class='term'>sudo gem1.9 install ruby-xslt</span> but we encounter:</p>

</pre>
<p>So we use <a href='#gem_solution'>the solution above</a> and we patch this gem to work by editing the <em>/usr/local/lib/ruby/gems/1.9.1/gems/ruby-xslt-0.9.6/ext/xslt_lib/extfunc.c</em>, line 141. We&#8217;ll also need to edit <em>/usr/local/lib/ruby/gems/1.9.1/gems/ruby-xslt-0.9.6/ext/xslt_lib/extfunc.c</em>, lines 504, 533 (two occurrences), parameters.c lines 42 and 43. Then run <pre class='markdown-html-error' style='border: solid 3px red; background-color: pink'>REXML could not parse this XML/HTML: 
&lt;span class=&apos;term&apos;&gt;sudo ruby extconf.rb &amp;&amp; sudo make &amp;&amp; sudo make install&lt;/span&gt;</pre> and this gem should install.</p>

<p>To install nokogiri, ensure you have followed the steps above and then <span class='term'>sudo gem1.9 install nokogiri</span>. Tested with nokogiri 1.2.3 and ruby-xslt 0.9.6.</p>
<h3>haml (2.2.0)</h3>
<p>haml works right out of the box too, throws some errors for <span class='term'>--inline-source</span> and has recently attained Ruby 1.9 compatibility.</p>
<h2>Further Notes</h2>
<p>I tried <a href='http://github.com/radar/rboard'>rboard</a> and that worked on this setup (with a <a href='http://github.com/Radar/rboard/commit/4a94cce6c562c106b7ce89042f2c6efbe3d533ef'>few minor tweaks to the paperclip plugin</a> and <a href='http://github.com/Radar/rboard/commit/591d3222494e7e546fe1d000055dacebf0ec8b9e'>the script commands</a>). I also had to freeze rails to <em>vendor/rails</em>.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>My original summary was that you should hold off completely from using Ruby 1.9.1, but that was back in January. Whilst &#8220;important&#8221; things such as the mysql gem and ruby-xslt are broken, there&#8217;s no real dealbreakers stopping you from running your applications on Ruby 1.9.1. As reassurance of this, <a href='http://m.wikipedia.org'>wikipedia's mobile site</a> is a merb application, running Ruby 1.9.1 and was <a href='http://techblog.wikimedia.org/2009/06/wikimedia-mobile-launch/'>launched last month</a> and handles a fair bit of traffic.</p>}]]></content>

   <updated>2009-01-30T00:00:00+10:00</updated>
   <id>http://ryanbigg.com/2009/01/webrat-woes</id>
   <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday I wrote a feature for one of the apps at work that was fairly simple it contained this line:</p>
<pre>
  clicks_link("I am done")
</pre>
<p>The page contained a link with the text exactly as &#8220;I am done&#8221; and in all dimensions of this universe you would expect this to pass without fault. It didn&#8217;t.</p>

<p>So when this feature failed I brought Bo over and got him to look at it. We couldn&#8217;t figure it out yesterday and it took a few hours this morning to figure out what it was. The site was fairly basic, consisting of a layout that contained:</p>
<pre class='markdown-html-error' style='border: solid 3px red; background-color: pink'>REXML could not parse this XML/HTML: 
&lt;pre lang=&apos;html&apos;&gt;
&lt;%= link_to &quot;Things&quot;, thing_path %&gt;
&lt;%= yield %&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;</pre>
<p>And the page itself consisted of a form and ended in the link:</p>
<pre class='markdown-html-error' style='border: solid 3px red; background-color: pink'>REXML could not parse this XML/HTML: 
&lt;pre lang=&apos;html&apos;&gt;
&lt;%= link_to &quot;I am done&quot;, do_something_path %&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;</pre>
<p>But the bloody feature failed! So we sanity check&#8217;d it, output the response&#8217;s body and definitely saw the a tag in there. It was there! So we further checked it and tried the URL from the layout and that worked! Major WTF moment there. It took us an hour or so of further WTF before Bo said &#8220;Humour me&#8221; and gave the layout valid HTML, you know, something like this:</p>
<pre lang='html'>
&lt;!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN"
   "http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/loose.dtd"&gt;

&lt;html lang="en"&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
  &lt;meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8"&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
  &lt;%= link_to "Things", things_path %&gt;
  &lt;%= yield %&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</pre>
<p>And the feature passed! So remember kids, do not be lazy! If you&#8217;re testing with webrat remember to always have a valid HTML layout on your site!</p>}]]></content>

   <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I left not-so-sunny South Australia without writing anything on my blog saying when I was going! Sorry to all my loyal readers who check at <strong>least</strong> 50 times daily to see if I have updated. It has been a long time my good friends but I am finally in sunny Queensland and today was my first day back at <a href='http://mocra.com'>Mocra</a> which was fantastic!</p>

<p>If any of you wish to come up and visit me, feel free. I do recommend however you fly up because the drive is not only costly, but very freakin&#8217; long (2000km) and very freakin&#8217; boring.</p>

<p>&#60;b&#62;Highlights of the trip&#60;/b&#62;</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>A sign that spanned about 30m on poles about double the thickness of my legs bent backwards with no marks on it whatsoever. It looked. as though the wind had done it.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Parkes Radio Telescope. Biggest. Dish. Ever.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>The ever decreasing distance to Brisbane.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Visiting half the states and territories of Australia.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Doing presentation of rboard at Brisbane Ruby Users Group!</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>&#60;b&#62;Lowlights&#60;/b&#62;</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>&#8220;Continue straight for 164km&#8221; or &#8220;At the roundabout take the second exit&#8221;, in 111km. There&#8217;s a long time between towns out there.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Losing my mind somewhere between Goondiwindi and Brisbane. Lost concentration and the mind went on a tangent, something about floating continents (think warships, but continents) and people with telekenesis. My imagination is weird and wonderful.</p>

   <title>How Rails Works #1: A Timezone Overview</title>
   <link href="http://ryanbigg.com/2008/12/a-timezone-overview"/>
   <updated>2008-12-31T00:00:00+10:00</updated>
   <id>http://ryanbigg.com/2008/12/a-timezone-overview</id>
   <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today fowlduck and I were talking in the #rubyonrails channel and we both wondered about timezones and why they were so (apparently) screwy. It turns out all I (and he possibly also) forgot to do was to put <span class='term'>config.time_zone</span> in the <i>config/environment.rb</i>. So what does this mysterious method do? Well: <h2>In Rails 2.2...</h2> <pre class='markdown-html-error' style='border: solid 3px red; background-color: pink'>REXML could not parse this XML/HTML: 
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1. &lt;b&gt;The &lt;span class=&apos;term&apos;&gt;Configuration&lt;/span&gt; Class&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
This class begins all the way down on &lt;a href=&apos;http://github.com/rails/rails/blob/2-2-stable/railties/lib/initializer.rb#L578&apos;&gt;line #578 of &lt;i&gt;railties/lib/initializer.rb&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in the Rails source. This just simply defines a class in the &lt;i&gt;Rails&lt;/i&gt; module called &lt;i&gt;Configuration&lt;/i&gt;. What we can get really excited about is on &lt;a href=&apos;http://github.com/rails/rails/blob/2-2-stable/railties/lib/initializer.rb#L748&apos;&gt;line #748&lt;/a&gt; it defines an &lt;span class=&apos;term&apos;&gt;&lt;a href=&apos;http://www.ruby-doc.org/core/classes/Module.html#M001704&apos;&gt;attr_accessor&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; for &lt;span class=&apos;term&apos;&gt;:time_zone&lt;/span&gt;. This, as you probably already know defines two methods a setter (&lt;span class=&apos;term&apos;&gt;time_zone=&lt;/span&gt;) and a getter (&lt;span class=&apos;term&apos;&gt;time_zone&lt;/span&gt;) in which we can store values.
  &lt;/li&gt;</pre></p>
<li>2. <b>Your <i>config/environment.rb</i> file</b><br />
By default this <span class='term'>time_zone</span> method will be set to nil. It's up to you to set it in your <i>config/environment.rb</i> file which you do by doing something along these lines:
<pre lang='rails'>
Rails::Initializer.run do |config|
  config.time_zone = "Adelaide"
end
</pre>

This will set the <span class='term'>time_zone</span> value to be the Adelaide Time zone, something like: <span class='term'>#&lt;ActiveSupport::TimeZone:0x30f4f8 @tzinfo=nil, @name="Adelaide", @utc_offset=34200&gt;</span>. You don't have to set it to Adelaide, just try your nearest major city and it Should Just Work &trade;. <u>If you <b>don't</b> set this in your <i>config/environment.rb</i> date and time values returned from the database will not be set to whatever time zone you specify.</u>
</li><li> 3. <b>Back to you, Jeff.</b>
When your application loads it processes the config/environment.rb file and runs the <span class='term'><a href='http://github.com/rails/rails/blob/2-2-stable/railties/lib/initializer.rb#L151'>initialize_time_zone</a></span> method which is defined <a href='http://github.com/rails/rails/blob/2-2-stable/railties/lib/initializer.rb#L496-508'>further down</a>.
This does all kinds of magic! Look at all the pretty sparkles! It firstly checks if you've set a time_zone in your <i>config/environment.rb</i> file and then if you have it sets the default time zone to be what you've specified. Additionally to this, it sets <span class='term'>time_zone_aware_attributes</span> to true so that when you do stuff like <span class='term'>Topic.last.created_at</span> it'll actually return the time zoned version of that time. It does this by calling into play <span class='term'><a href='http://github.com/rails/rails/blob/2-2-stable/activerecord/lib/active_record/attribute_methods.rb#L167-177'>define_read_method_for_time_zone_conversion(attr_name)</a></span> (click for juicy details) which either just returns the time or calls <span class='term'>in_time_zone</span> on the time returned which converts it into the time zone stored in <span class='term'>Time.zone</span> (which is <a href='http://github.com/rails/rails/blob/2-2-stable/activesupport/lib/active_support/core_ext/time/zones.rb#L15'>actually <span class='term'>Thread.current[:time_zone]</span></a> if there is one stored there or otherwise the <span class='term'>zone_default</span> which was originally set when we called <span class='term'>config.time_zone</span>! What a mouthful!

By default, ActiveRecord will store timestamps as UTC as shown by <span class='term'>ActiveRecord::Base.default_timezone = :utc</span>. If you don't specify a time zone in your <i>config/environment.rb</i> this value defaults to :local, so all times will be stored as the local time in your database.
</li><li> 4. <b> And then... </b> 
So, assuming you did as the above when you go into your script/console and type: <span class='term'>Topic.last.created_at</span> you'll get back the time when the topic was created relative to Adelaide. To change this, just redefine <span class='term'>Time.zone</span> by doing <span class='term'>Time.zone= "Paris"</span> and then doing <span class='term'>Topic.last.created_at</span> will give you time when the topic was created relative to Paris.
</li><pre class='markdown-html-error' style='border: solid 3px red; background-color: pink'>REXML could not parse this XML/HTML: 
&lt;/ul&gt;</pre><h3>Changelog</h3><strong>Updated on April 23rd, 2009</strong>

   <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today <a href='http://rails.loglibrary.com/chats/15273022'>keiran_nz</a> asked how to see SQL statements that occur when running code in script/console. After a little bit of mucking around in the terminal I worked it out to be:</p>
<pre class='markdown-html-error' style='border: solid 3px red; background-color: pink'>REXML could not parse this XML/HTML: 
&lt;span class=&apos;term&apos;&gt;tail -f log/development.log &amp; script/console&lt;/span&gt;</pre>
<p>The first comment on this post Ashley Williams says you could do:</p>
<pre class='markdown-html-error' style='border: solid 3px red; background-color: pink'>REXML could not parse this XML/HTML: 
&lt;span class=&apos;term&apos;&gt;tail -f log/development.log &amp; clear &amp;&amp; script/console&lt;/span&gt;</pre>
<p>instead, and then goes further and sticks it in an alias in your .bashrc file (presumably):</p>
<pre class='markdown-html-error' style='border: solid 3px red; background-color: pink'>REXML could not parse this XML/HTML:

<p>This is fantastic because when I&#8217;m asked if people can use rBoard they need to integrate it into an existing app, rather than having it stand alone. A lot of that would be massaging it all in to your app, but now you can have it as a separate plugin with it&#8217;s own app/* folders and config/routes.rb file too.</p>}]]></content>

<p>Let&#8217;s say you have a model called Blog and this is what you want to match to http://domain.com/frozenplague-rules-my-world. In this model you define:</p>
<b>app/models/blog.rb</b><pre lang='rails'>
def to_param
  "#{id}-#{title.parameterize}"
end
</pre>
<p>And then this in your config/routes.rb <pre lang='rails'>
map.connect ':slug', :controller => "blogs", :action => "show"
</pre></p>

<p>And now you should be able to access blogs through http://domain.com/frozenplague-rules-my-world.</p>}]]></content>

The three instances that I&#8217;ve encountered this year are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The guy I hit with my car has a friend who's dad works with my dad</li>
  <li>Yesterday had a barbecue @ James's house and met up with somebody who uses the Netfox product</li>

   <title>Railscamp #4</title>
   <link href="http://ryanbigg.com/2008/11/railscamp-4"/>
   <updated>2008-11-17T00:00:00+10:00</updated>
   <id>http://ryanbigg.com/2008/11/railscamp-4</id>
   <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If somebody had told me that 6 months ago on this day I would be cleaning toilets I would&#8217;ve laughed at them. But, that&#8217;s how Railscamp #4 ended, just me and the SeaLink guys (Adam, Anuj &amp; Vishal) cleaning the Bunk House.</p>
<h3>Some Information</h3>
<p>There&#8217;s a lot that goes into running an event like this. It started shortly after Railscamp #3 when discussion was going on in #roro about the next event and somehow the onus was put on us Adelaidians to hold an event in the coming months. We thought about choosing a sea-side venue for a start, but the ones I contacted were too expensive. Anthony Richardson (hereafter referred to as Richo) suggested <a href='http://www.woodhouse.org.au'>Woodhouse</a> and that was seconded by a friend of mine and so we explored the venue and I fell in love. The prices and dates and size and &#8230; everything was fabulous. Booked that in right away and paid the deposit. Cost was $20 per head in a bunk, $10 per camper.</p>

<p>The catering was dealt with by Anthony (but recommended by the venue&#8217;s website) which was fantastic. $50 per head for that wide of a choice of food was just marvelous.</p>

<p>For the projector screens we went with a company called <a href='http://hire-intelligence.com.au'>Hire Intelligence</a>. $75 per screen.</p>

<p>For the projectors Dr Nic brought his and so did anathematic (Thomas Sinclair)</p>

<p>Extra chairs + tables were hired from Atlas Party Hire. 25 chairs + 5 tables was $219.95.</p>

<p>Attendees were hired from the Ruby on Rails community, but can usually be found anywhere near sources of electricity and alcohol.</p>
<h3>I'd like to thank...</h3>
<p>Although I was the one who put the deposit down on the venue, there&#8217;s people who did way more than me.</p>

<p>Firstly, thanks to Richo for everything (yes, even yelling at me on Friday night), you&#8217;ve opened my eyes to a whole new world of &#8220;let someone else do it&#8221;. Also thanks for the pancakes and just generally being there to help run things.</p>

<p>Secondly, on Sunday morning there was one person out of the whole seven who were up who helped me do the dishes and that was Pythonic (Nick Jefferson). Thanks man, was feeling a bit overwhelmed at the time.</p>

<p>Thirdly, thanks to those of you (all of you!) who just cleaned up general. Nothing worse than trying to code surrounded by mess. Also those of you who were still cleaning up after the bus left.</p>

<p>Thanks to <a href='http://lstoll.net'>Lincoln Stoll</a> for all his work setting up the servers / network.</p>

<p>Thanks to the caterers for absolutely kicking ass on the cooking duties. Beautiful work ladies, well worth the money.</p>

<p>Thanks to Pat Allan for coming and sharing his Sphinx wisdom and holy presence with us, and especially for the Werewolf deck and moderating a couple of games. On a similar line, thanks to Myles for narrating a few games whilst under the influence of &#8220;just a couple&#8221; of drinks.</p>

<p>Thanks to Lachie for his manipulation of twitter messages. Now, if only the real Twitter did something like that for April Fools.</p>

<p>Thanks to whoever it was who left the Monopoly board out. I think I missed out on a few excellent presentations (judging by the applause) whilst I got my ass handed to me by Tom.</p>

<p>Thanks to those of you who did presentations and got heckled by Dr. Nic.</p>

<p>Thanks to Pete Yandell for making (not during railscamp, but before) and presenting Machinist, what appears to be an excellent replacement for fixtures.</p>

<p>Thanks to those who left iChat open and therefore allowed me to troll their presentations, especially Brenton Fletcher. Thanks to the Apple iPhone team who put Crickets as a ringtone for the iPhone as well and Rick Astley for his song of joy and love.</p>

<p>Thanks to chendo for writing cryptoquote, a word game where you get a quote that is encrypted, for example e = w and d = f and so on and you have to say stuff like e=w in a chat-like text box which will reveal your answer to be correct and give you points. It has a lot of promise to be a great procrastination tool for a lot of people.</p>

<p>And the best for last, all the attendees who were there for one, two, three or all four days. Without you guys there would be no Railscamp and no awesome Australian Rails community. You guys are the greatest people I know.</p>}]]></content>

   <title>Dear India</title>
   <link href="http://ryanbigg.com/2008/11/dear-india"/>
   <updated>2008-11-05T00:00:00+10:00</updated>
   <id>http://ryanbigg.com/2008/11/dear-india</id>
   <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I grow weary of you undercutting us honest workers in the web design industry and sending people who obviously do not know how to speak the English language into a primarily english based programming language. Perhaps, if you taught them how to speak the language the code is written in, then perhaps I would not be writing this blog post. I am not intending to be racist, but if it comes across that way I don&#8217;t really care. I worked with two people from different regions of India for near-on 8 months and they were two of the smartest (and greatest) people I have ever met.</p>

<p>Your <s>slaves</s> workers come into #rubyonrails and ask in their distorted english extremely vague questions and expect us to help them with little or no clue as to what they&#8217;re trying to do. Then when you ask them, it takes them forever to respond because they have to translate from their language, to ours. It is annoying and frankly I am no longer willing to put up with it. From now on anybody from India asking a question in #rubyonrails will be promptly placed on my ignore list unless they simply: 1) Ask in clear, concise English 2) Explain what their problem is rather than going &#8220;can any1 hlp me plz????&#8221;</p>

<p>What I am asking here is that before throwing them into the deep end of a programming language, teach them how to speak English (and not that shorthand crap either) and how to be polite and courteous and grateful for the <b>free</b> help we hand out on a daily basis in #rubyonrails. That&#8217;s all, no strings attached. Simple.</p>

   <title>I18n: An Overview</title>
   <link href="http://ryanbigg.com/2008/10/i18n-an-overview"/>
   <updated>2008-10-29T00:00:00+10:00</updated>
   <id>http://ryanbigg.com/2008/10/i18n-an-overview</id>
   <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Welcome to yet another overview, this time it&#8217;s on the new I18n features in Rails 2.2 which you can install by typing <span class='term'>gem install rails -s http://gems.rubyonrails.org -v 2.2.0</span>.</p>

<p>Any mention of the <span class='term'>t</span> method in this guide are also spots where you can use <span class='term'>translate</span> too, they are just aliased methods (t is aliased to translate), it&#8217;s just much easier (for me) to type t than it is to type translate. Please excuse my laziness.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve begun adding in the translation calls for rboard in my <a href='http://github.com/radar/rboard/tree/radar'>personal branch on GitHub</a> and today I would like to show you how I&#8217;ve done it.</p>

<p>Firstly I have added these two lines to my <i>config/environment.rb</i>:</p>
<b>config/environment.rb</b><pre lang='rails'>
I18n.load_path = Dir.glob("#{RAILS_ROOT}/locales/*.rb")
I18n.default_locale = "en-AU"
</pre>
<p>This tells rails to load the translation files (aka locale files) from the locales directory in the root of my rails app, and they are in a ruby format. Alternatively you could load yaml files. this also tells it to set the default locale as &#8220;en-AU&#8221;, which will load <i>locales/en-AU.rb</i> by default.</p>

<p>My (incomplete) translation file looks like this: <b>locales/en-AU.rb</b> <pre lang='rails'>
{
  :'en-AU' => {
   :forum_heading => "Forum",
   :topics_heading => "Topics",
   :posts_heading => "Posts",
   :last_post_heading => "Last Post",
   :no_forums => "There are no forums.", 
   :administrator_should_create_forum => "Maybe an administrator should create one.",
   :you_should_create_forum => "Maybe you should create a forum.",
   :forum_statistics => "Forum Statistics",
   :posts_per_topic => "Posts per topic",
   :recent_users => "Users on in the last 15 minutes",
   :registered_users => "Registered Users",
   :home => "Home",
   :edit_profile => "Edit Profile",
   :member_list => "Member List",
   :search => "Search",
   :new_message => "new message",
   :logout => "Logout",
   :time_now => "The time is now",
   :viewing_forum => "Viewing forum",
   :new_topic => "New Topic",
   :moderation_heading => "Moderation",
   :topic_heading => "Topic",
   :replies_heading => "Replies",
   :views_heading => "Views",
   :author_heading => "Author",
   :ago => "ago",
   :by => "by"
  }
}
</pre></p>

<p>When I have a string I want translated in my app I will simply call stuff like <span class='term'>t(:author_heading)</span> and Rails will look up the correct translation for it, which in this case is just &#8220;Author&#8221;.</p>

<p>Now if I had another translation file, say <i>locales/es.rb</i> and I had Spanish users on rboard they could select a locale from their profile page and that would store it as a string on their user record. To translate this, we can use a before_filter on the application controller:</p>
<b>app/controllers/application.rb</b><pre class='markdown-html-error' style='border: solid 3px red; background-color: pink'>REXML could not parse this XML/HTML: 
&lt;pre lang=&apos;rails&apos;&gt;
class ApplicationController &lt; ActionController::Base
  before_filter :set_locale
  def set_locale
    I18n.locale = current_user.locale if logged_in?
  end
end
&lt;/pre&gt;</pre>
<p>This will set the locale to whatever the user has set, providing that they are logged in.</p>
<h3>Interpolation</h3>
<p>If you wish to insert a value into a translation you can use interpolation. To do this you can specify the t method call like this:</p>
<b>in a i18n-friendly file somewhere</b><pre class='markdown-html-error' style='border: solid 3px red; background-color: pink'>REXML could not parse this XML/HTML: 
&lt;pre lang=&apos;rails&apos;&gt;
&lt;%= t(:welcome, :user =&gt; current_user.login) %&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;</pre>
<p>And then in your locales file specify this:</p>
<b>locales/en-AU.rb</b><pre lang='rails'>
:welcome => "welcome !"
</pre>
<p>And the output of the translation will now be &#8220;welcome Ryan!&#8221; or whatever the user login was.</p>
<h3>Counting</h3>
<p>If you have a translation such as <span class='term'>:x_new_messages</span> in your translation file and you want the output of this translation to be correctly pluralized you can pass the count option to this:</p>
<b>In any <span class='term'>t</span> method supporting files</b><pre class='markdown-html-error' style='border: solid 3px red; background-color: pink'>REXML could not parse this XML/HTML: 
&lt;pre lang=&apos;rails&apos;&gt;
&lt;%= t(:x_new_messages, :count =&gt; current_user.messages.size) %&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;</pre>
<p>The <span class='term'>x_</span> prefix to our translation is not important, it&#8217;s just there to show us that this translation may return different results depending on the count that is passed to it.</p>

<p>Then in your translation file you can do:</p>
<b>locales/en-AU.rb</b><pre lang='rails'>
:x_new_messages => {:zero => 'No new messages', :one => 'One new message', :other => ' new messages'}
</pre>
<p>And depending on the value of count it will return one of those three outcomes.</p>
<h3>Forcing a Locale</h3>
<p>If you want to force a locale on a single translation you can do this by specifying the &lt;span class=&#8217;term&#8217;&gt;:locale&lt;/option&gt; to the t method call like so:</p>
<pre class='markdown-html-error' style='border: solid 3px red; background-color: pink'>REXML could not parse this XML/HTML: 
&lt;pre lang=&apos;rails&apos;&gt;
&lt;%= t(:english, :locale =&gt; &quot;en-AU&quot;) %&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;</pre>
<p>And this will always show the en-AU translation of the english key in the en-AU.rb locale file.</p>
<h3>Alternative Translations</h3>
<p>If one of your translations does not match like:</p>
<pre class='markdown-html-error' style='border: solid 3px red; background-color: pink'>REXML could not parse this XML/HTML: 
&lt;pre lang=&apos;rails&apos;&gt;
&lt;%= t(:norsk) %&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;</pre>
<p>You can have I18n fall back to any number of other translations:</p>
<pre class='markdown-html-error' style='border: solid 3px red; background-color: pink'>REXML could not parse this XML/HTML: 
&lt;pre lang=&apos;rails&apos;&gt;
&lt;%= t(:norsk, :default =&gt; [:norwegian, :up_north, :northwards, &quot;norway&quot;]) %&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;</pre>
<p>I18n will attempt to get a default translation from the options specified and will select the first one. If all translations failed then the string version, &#8220;norway&#8221; will be outputted.</p>
<h3>Retrieving Multiple Translations</h3>
<p>To get multiple translations back at the same time you can specify an array as the first argument to the t method.</p>
<pre class='markdown-html-error' style='border: solid 3px red; background-color: pink'>REXML could not parse this XML/HTML: 
&lt;pre lang=&apos;rails&apos;&gt;
&lt;%= t(:forums, :topics) %&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;</pre>
<p>Assuming you have correct translations for forums and topics you will get the translated versions returned in an array. Assuming you don&#8217;t have the correct translations for forums OR topics you will get back a string version of whatever translation is missing, possibly wrapped in a <span class='term'>&lt;span class='translation_missing'&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</span>.</p>

<p>Further translation files can be found at <a href='http://github.com/svenfuchs/rails-i18n/tree/master/rails'>Sven Fuch's Github Repository</a></p>}]]></content>

This is in the interest of seeing how much merb actually kicks Rails&#8217; ass and a learning experience for me.</p>

<p>Also, Merb&#8217;s source code is very, very pretty.</p>}]]></content>

   <title>Throat Cramps</title>
   <link href="http://ryanbigg.com/2008/10/throat-cramps"/>
   <updated>2008-10-16T00:00:00+10:00</updated>
   <id>http://ryanbigg.com/2008/10/throat-cramps</id>
   <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Occasionally when I&#8217;m moving my head I get these throat cramps just on the right side of my throat. During these cramping phases the muscle (?) that moves up and down when you swallow (have a look in the mirror and watch your throat as you swallow, you&#8217;ll know what I mean) is what cramps. This can be extremely painful and I know of nobody else who gets these. I can only describe it as a cramp. There is a large sharp pain (kind of like when you get hit in the throat) when swallowing and a slightly lesser pain when I tilt my head backwards or to the left. Again, this only happens on one side of my throat.</p>

<p>I was prescribed anti-histamine tablets last year for this problem and it&#8217;s only manifested itself 4 times since then, the last 2 times have been within a month of each other. Generally, tilting my head back and drinking about a litre of water helps, but not the last two times. The last two times I&#8217;ve had to wait it out, and it&#8217;s been 3 hours and 1 hour respectively.</p>

<p>Has anybody out there in the blogosphere heard of this before?</p>}]]></content>

Some idiot(s) in the middle of the night smashed the corner of my back-right window and rifled through my car looking for something. Obviously they didn&#8217;t find it because the car is still there. They changed the gearstick to reverse, took off the handbrake and moved an American flag I had in the boot into the backseat (I know! The outrage!). Everything&#8217;s still in the car, just in more disarray than usual.</p>}]]></content>

   <id>http://ryanbigg.com/2008/09/super-consumer</id>
   <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>So I have this friend who&#8217;s the same age as me. He doesn&#8217;t work. He doesn&#8217;t appear to be actively looking for work. He got &#8220;fired&#8221; from his last job because he wasn&#8217;t fast enough, but apparently the boss was an asshole. There was an excuse for the job before it too, but I can&#8217;t remember what that was. He&#8217;s constantly getting new things. I&#8217;d like to refer to him as a &#8220;super-consumer&#8221;, someone who has too much. He loves NERF and Transformers (keeping in mind he&#8217;s the same age as me). He&#8217;s never outwardly happy with the things he has, and is constantly in a &#8220;covet thy neighbour&#8221; state of mind (and he&#8217;s Christian!), always wanting the next level up as soon as it&#8217;s been released. Take for instance the graphics card I won at AsLAN in a silent auction. He asked me if <b>I</b> could put <b>my</b> brand new graphics card into <b>his</b> media center. His argument was for when he has movie nights, then I will appreciate the gift I gave unto him. Admittedly, it&#8217;s a card I have no use for, at the moment, but it&#8217;s always handy to have a spare in case things go wrong. So, rather than him actually putting the energy used into his craving for all that is new &amp; shiny into finding work so that he can buy all that is new &amp; shiny, he just craves. I think this path is going to destroy him, and there&#8217;s nothing I can do or say that will open his eyes to what he is bringing on himself.</p>}]]></content>

   <title>Single Table Inheritance</title>
   <link href="http://ryanbigg.com/2008/09/multiple-user-access-levels"/>
   <updated>2008-09-28T00:00:00+10:00</updated>
   <id>http://ryanbigg.com/2008/09/multiple-user-access-levels</id>
   <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This tutorial was written using Ruby 1.8.6, Rails 2.1.</p>

<p>A lot of the time I see people asking how they can do something like access levels for their Rails applications and this usually boils down to some STI (single table inheritance) love. You&#8217;ll need to have <a href='http://github.com/technoweenie/restful-authentication/tree/master'>restful_authentication</a> installed. <h3>What is Single Table Inhertiance?</h3> Single Table Inheritance is where you have multiple models that inherit from a single table, hence the name. It&#8217;s great for situations like this where we want multiple user access levels, but we don&#8217;t want to create multiple tables for the different kinds of users of our application. <h3>Okay.. so how do I use it?</h3> Firstly you start off with one model that inherits from <span class='term'>ActiveRecord::Base</span>, and I would advise running <span class='term'>script/generate authenticated person session</span> to get this:</p>
<strong>app/models/person.rb</strong><pre class='markdown-html-error' style='border: solid 3px red; background-color: pink'>REXML could not parse this XML/HTML: 
&lt;pre lang=&quot;rails&quot;&gt;class Person &lt; ActiveRecord::Base

end&lt;/pre&gt;
And then you subclass some other classes from &lt;span class=&quot;term&quot;&gt;Person&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;app/models/student.rb&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;pre lang=&quot;rails&quot;&gt;class Student &lt; Person

end&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;app/models/teacher.rb&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;pre lang=&quot;rails&quot;&gt;class Teacher &lt; Person

end&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;app/models/admin.rb&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;pre lang=&quot;rails&quot;&gt;class Admin &lt; Person

end&lt;/pre&gt;

The great thing about splitting these into individual files is because they&apos;re more easily managed and closely follows the convention of one model per file.

Now you have a person, student and teacher model and you should have a brand new migration for your people table in &lt;em&gt;db/migrate&lt;/em&gt; so go on and open that up and you&apos;ll see something like this:
&lt;pre lang=&quot;rails&quot;&gt;class CreatePeople &lt; ActiveRecord::Migration
  def self.up
    create_table &quot;people&quot;, :force =&gt; true do |t|
      t.column :login,                     :string, :limit =&gt; 40
      t.column :name,                      :string, :limit =&gt; 100, :default =&gt; &apos;&apos;, :null =&gt; true
      t.column :email,                     :string, :limit =&gt; 100
      t.column :crypted_password,          :string, :limit =&gt; 40
      t.column :salt,                      :string, :limit =&gt; 40
      t.column :created_at,                :datetime
      t.column :updated_at,                :datetime
      t.column :remember_token,            :string, :limit =&gt; 40
      t.column :remember_token_expires_at, :datetime

    end
    add_index :people, :login, :unique =&gt; true
  end

  def self.down
    drop_table &quot;people&quot;
  end
end&lt;/pre&gt;
To enable STI for this table, just add:
&lt;pre lang=&quot;rails&quot;&gt;t.column :type, :string&lt;/pre&gt;
into the create_table block, just after &lt;span class=&quot;term&quot;&gt;t.column :remember_token_expires_at, :datetime&lt;/span&gt;. This type column will be set to whatever class the record is, so if we create a new Student object, this type column will be set to &quot;Student&quot;.

&lt;h3&gt;Controllers&lt;/h3&gt;
To create new objects for these subclasses I would recommend building a people controller and using the form partial from that to base your form off from the other controllers, such as &lt;span class=&apos;term&apos;&gt;StudentsController&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class=&apos;term&apos;&gt;TeachersController&lt;/span&gt;. These controllers should &lt;strong&gt;NOT&lt;/strong&gt; subclass from PeopleController, they should be their own independent controllers because Teachers, People and Students are all individual resource types. 

&lt;h3&gt;Associated Models&lt;/h3&gt;

If you have associated models (e.g. Person has_many :enrolments), any subclass of Person will inherit this relationship. For the relationship, this will be referenced via person_id still in the enrolments table.</pre>}]]></content>

   <title>How To Ask For Help</title>
   <link href="http://ryanbigg.com/2008/09/how-to-ask-for-help"/>
   <updated>2008-09-25T00:00:00+10:00</updated>
   <id>http://ryanbigg.com/2008/09/how-to-ask-for-help</id>
   <content type="html"><![CDATA[<ol>
	<li><strong>Have you tried stopping your server and starting it? This fixes many problems and may fix yours!</strong></li>
	<li>If you're getting a NoMethodError which ends in "The error occured when evaluating nil.method" this means you're trying to call a method on a nil object! Check the object that you're calling that method on and make sure that it actually is set!</li>
	<li><strong>Google the error message. </strong>If you're getting "undefined method `blah`", try googling just "undefined method". Never ask a question without googling first.</li>
	<li>State your problem clearly. Never, ever say "I have a problem plzzzz help me !!!1!" or " is not working" or something to that effect. Say, for example, that you're getting an undefined method. Type "pastie: hi" into the channel and the pastie bot will send you a link via private message where you<strong> can show us your code, stack trace and error. Giving all three will provide us 99% of the time with the information we need to help you solve your problem.
</strong></li>
	<li>Don't use dummy examples. An example would be asking a question like "How does A relate to B?" when asking "How does a blog relate to comment?".</li>
	<li>Don't ask "can you do &lt;thing&gt; with Rails?", because the most often answer is "Yes". Ask rather "How can you do &lt;thing&gt; with Rails?"</li>
	<li>Don't ask to ask, just ask.</li>
	<li>Paste anything over 3 lines of code using the pastie service (type "pastie: hello") into the channel and the pastie bot will send you a link via private message where you can put your code.</li>
	<li>Don't ask "Has anybody used &lt;thing&gt;?" rather state your problem that you're having with &lt;thing&gt; and somebody may be able to help you. See #2.</li>
	<li>Don't prefix your question with a statement or another question. For example just write your problem rather than prefixing it with something like "Can anyone help me with this? &lt;problem&gt;" or "I am a noob help me with &lt;problem&gt;" or "I have a problem... &lt;problem&gt;" it's a waste of your time typing it out and a waste of our time reading it.</li>
	<li>Computers never lie.</li>
	<li>Don't ask subjective questions. "Subjective" means a question that's answer is entirely opinion based, such as questions like "What is the best text editor?" or "What is the best testing framework?"</li>

   <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The site <a href='http://twonklist.com'>twonklist.com</a> was an idea conceived of at my last job (NetFox) and I coded it up in a night or two with Brenton Fletcher adding the styling in later on.</p>

<p>This afternoon it was defaced. I have since removed all the awesome pictures a certain person put on the site, and it&#8217;s a person who apparently has a grudge against me. Now, I know who this person is. I even know their IP is 122.109.249.211. I know their ISP is Optus. I&#8217;ve even sent an email (with screenshots!) in the vain hope that they&#8217;ll do something about it, but they most likely will not. Now if you have a grudge against me, the way to go about things is to not deface any of my sites. You come to me, face to face, as a man and talk to me. I&#8217;m available most days. Say what you like, just don&#8217;t deface my sites.</p>

<p>Congratulations to this person, as now all the requests from any IP beginning with 122.109 will <a href='http://www.google.com/search?q=how+not+to+be+a+fucktard'>go to a very useful/useless google search entry</a>. Yes, that basically means the entire Optus network.</p>}]]></content>

   <title>The Accident: Followup #1</title>

   <id>http://ryanbigg.com/2008/09/the-accident-followup-1</id>
   <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This is a followup to my <a href='http://frozenplague.net/2008/08/10/inlan/'>InLAN blog post</a>, best to read that first to get the whole story.</p>

<p>So today I get a phone call from Allianz about my compulsory 3rd party insurance and they told me the guy is filing a personal injury claim and apparently has &#8220;legal representation&#8221;. They asked me all kinds of questions like &#8220;Were you using a mobile phone?&#8221;, &#8220;Did you get alcohol testing?&#8221;, &#8220;Were you and your passenger wearing a seatbelt?&#8221; and so on.</p>

<p>What really amazes me is that someone who, despite the thousands of years of evolution the human race has undergone, still thinks it possible to file a personal injury claim <strong>for an accident he caused</strong>. Had he not bolted out of the bushes onto the road, <strong>whilst it was raining AND in the middle of the night</strong>, this would have never happened. You (and the insurance company) can only take my word that I&#8217;m not a homocidal maniac who enjoys late night rampages that involve running over pedestrians and causing hundreds of dollars worth of damage to my dearly beloved car, not to mention my state of mind.</p>

<p>If I have to pay this guy a cent, that will be the last of my faith in humanity gone for quite a while.</p>}]]></content>

   <title>Ham & Rocket Rolls</title>
   <link href="http://ryanbigg.com/2008/09/ham-rocket-rolls"/>
   <updated>2008-09-10T00:00:00+10:00</updated>
   <id>http://ryanbigg.com/2008/09/ham-rocket-rolls</id>
   <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Usually I post technically minded stuff, but today I decided to share my &#8220;recipe&#8221;. Mum and Darrel have gone away for a month so I&#8217;ve been left to fend for myself with my cooking skills near to non-existant. I can microwave, I can toast and I can simmer.</p>

<p>For the past few days I&#8217;ve been eating these hamburger rolls from woolworths stuff with various ingredients and I&#8217;ve found that ham (any kind) and cream cheese go nicely together. <a href='http://twitter.com/radarlistener/statuses/914626125'>I tweeted yesterday</a> about having the rolls and got the opposite reaction to what I expected, <a href='http://twitter.com/nikc/statuses/914696988'>nikc recommended I try putting rocket on it</a>. Also with me being a long-time fan of cream cheese and sweet chilli sauce (the only two liquids I find that complement each other so perfectly), I put that on the roll too.</p>

<p>&#8220;What was the end result?&#8221;, I hear you speak through the saliva drooling from your mouth. It was this:</p>
<b>Ingredients</b><ul>
<li>Knife to cut rolls</li>
<li>Sandwich Toaster (optional)</li>
<li>1 Hamburger Roll</li>
<li>Cream Cheese</li>
<li>Sweet Chilli Sauce</li>
<li>Rocket leaves</li>
<li>Honey Baked Ham</li>
</ul><b>Preparation:</b><ol>
<li>Cut rolls directly down the middle and lightly toast them for about a minute on the sandwich toaster (optional)</li>
<li>Spread cream cheese lightly on both sides of the rolls</li>
<li>Put ham on top of the cream cheese</li>
<li>Put a drop of sweet chilli sauce on the ham and spread</li>
<li>Tear off some rocket leaves and spread over ham</li>
<li>Put roll back together</li>
</ol>
<p>Thanks to the viscosity of the cream cheese and sweet chilli sauce combination, your roll should stay nicely packed together.</p>

   <title>Ubuntu, Rails, Apache, Passenger, Capistrano & You</title>
   <link href="http://ryanbigg.com/2008/09/ubuntu-rails-apache-passenger-capistrano-you"/>
   <updated>2008-09-03T00:00:00+10:00</updated>
   <id>http://ryanbigg.com/2008/09/ubuntu-rails-apache-passenger-capistrano-you</id>
   <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2>Now What?</h2>
<p>So you&#8217;ve got a freshly installed copy of Ubuntu Server, you&#8217;ve logged into the server with your intent being to create a Rails server&#8230; only you don&#8217;t know how or you&#8217;re not entirely sure. Good thing this guide&#8217;s here to guide you through that.&lt;/h2&gt; Right now you should have a prompt like this: <span class='term'>you@server:~$ _</span>. If you don&#8217;t, I can recommend one of three things: <ol>
	<li>Turn on your screen.</li>
	<li>Log into the server (if it's remote)</li>
	<li>Install the operating system first.</li>
</ol> Other than that, you&#8217;re on your own.</p>

<p>I would recommend running <span class='term'>sudo apt-get dist-upgrade</span> right now. This should only take a few seconds as it downloads and installs all the packages.</p>

<p>Firstly you&#8217;ll want to update the sources for your system by running <span class='term'>sudo apt-get update</span>, this is so Ubuntu knows where to find the packages. (<a href='http://frozenplague.net/2008/09/ubuntu-rails-apache-passenger-capistrano-you/comment-page-1/#comment-8522'>Props to Ryan G for his comment)</a></p>

<p>The next thing we want to install is build-essential, which can be done by typing: <span class='term'>sudo apt-get install build-essential</span> and this will install all the essential packages you need in order to compile stuff on your machine.</p>

<p>We&#8217;ll now want to add a user that we can deploy to. We&#8217;ll call this user deploy and we&#8217;ll add it using <span class='term'>useradd deploy -m</span> with the -m option creating the /home/deploy directory for us. <h2>MySQL users</h2> You&#8217;ll need to install MySQL by issuing <span class='term'>sudo apt-get install mysql-server</span> <h2>PostgreSQL users</h2> You&#8217;ll need to install PostgreSQL (unless you selected that option when installing Ubuntu Server) by issuing <span class='term'>sudo apt-get install postgresql</span> <h2>Ruby, Ruby, Ruby, Ruby!</h2> Now you&#8217;ll need to install ruby and all the associated packages, using the command that resembles this: <span class='term'>sudo apt-get install ruby-full ruby1.8-dev</span> and will install the following packages:</p>
<strong>irb1.8</strong><strong>libopenssl-ruby1.8</strong><strong>libreadline-ruby1.8</strong><strong>libruby-1.8 &amp; ruby1.8 &amp; ruby 1.8-dev</strong><strong>rdoc1.8 &amp; rdoc</strong><strong>ri1.8 &amp; ri </strong>
<p>Ruby is now installed as ruby1.8. Now, if you&#8217;re like me and don&#8217;t like typing any more than you have to, you can symbolically link this ruby1.8 file to just /usr/bin/ruby. To do this, just type <span class='term'>sudo ln -s /usr/bin/ruby1.8 /usr/bin/ruby</span> and it&#8217;s all done. This way, you can type ruby AND ruby1.8 and it&#8217;ll do the same thing.</p>

<p>After that&#8217;s all done, head over to the <a href='http://rubyforge.org/frs/?group_id=126'>the rubygems download page</a> and get Rubygems 1.3.1, unpack it and install it yourself. Alternatively, you could use this command and it&#8217;ll download it, unpack and install it for you and do some clean up after:</p>

<pre><code>wget http://rubyforge.org/frs/download.php/38646/rubygems-1.3.1.tgz &amp;&amp;
gunzip rubygems-1.3.1.tgz &amp;&amp;
tar xf rubygems-1.3.1.tar &amp;&amp;
cd rubygems-1.3.1 &amp;&amp;
sudo ruby setup.rb &amp;&amp;
cd .. &amp;&amp;
rm -r rubygems-1.3.1*</code></pre>

<p>Rubygems installs an executable called gem1.8, which again is more typing than what we need. We&#8217;ll just symbolically link this one too: <span class='term'>sudo ln -s /usr/bin/gem1.8 /usr/bin/gem</span></p>

<p>Now we can install Rails and Passenger by typing <span class='term'>sudo gem install rails passenger</span>. This will install Rails and Passenger, along with all the required dependencies.</p>
<h2>Apache &amp; Passenger</h2>
<p>The next step is to install apache: <span class='term'>sudo apt-get install apache2-mpm-prefork apache2-prefork-dev</span> which will install a whole slew of packages including an apache2 server and the development headers for it, too many in fact that I shall not list them here! Just trust me on this one.</p>

<p>After this is done, run <span class='term'>sudo passenger-install-apache2-module</span> and follow the instructions there. After it&#8217;s done pay attention to the last three lines it tells you to put into your apache configuration file:</p>

<pre><code>LoadModule passenger_module /usr/lib/ruby/gems/1.8/gems/passenger-2.0.6/ext/apache2/mod_passenger.so
PassengerRoot /usr/lib/ruby/gems/1.8/gems/passenger-2.0.6
PassengerRuby /usr/bin/ruby1.8</code></pre>

<p>For that last line, you can use either /usr/bin/ruby1.8 or /usr/bin/ruby, since we symbolically linked them all that time ago. We&#8217;re going to put these lines into /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/000-default at the top of the file and change a few things in the file and our end result should look like this:</p>

<pre><code>LoadModule passenger_module /usr/lib/ruby/gems/1.8/gems/passenger-2.0.6/ext/apache2/mod_passenger.so
PassengerRoot /usr/lib/ruby/gems/1.8/gems/passenger-2.0.6
PassengerRuby /usr/bin/ruby1.8

NameVirtualHost *

ServerAdmin you@somewhere.com
DocumentRoot /home/deploy/app/current/public
ErrorLog /var/log/apache2/error.log
LogLevel warn
CustomLog /var/log/apache2/access.log combined
ServerSignature On</code></pre>

<p>After editing this file you&#8217;ll need to restart Apache by typing: <span class='term'>sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 restart</span>. Also, you may want to remove the index.html file currently residing in /var/www by tpying <span class='term'>sudo rm /var/www/index.html</span> <h2>Capistrano</h2> Now you want to deploy your uber-mega-ultra-hyper application to the server! To do this we can use Capistrano. If you haven&#8217;t already, on your development machine install Capistrano by typing <span class='term'>sudo gem install capistrano</span>. When Capistrano is installed go into your uber-mega-ultra-hyper application&#8217;s root directory and type <span class='term'>capify  .</span>. This will capify (say it out loud in an announcer-style voice, oh yeah) your application by creating a <em>Capfile</em> in the root path and a <em>deploy.rb</em> file in the <em>config</em> folder. What we&#8217;re really interested in here is the <em>config/deploy.rb</em> file which now looks kind of sparse:</p>

<pre><code>set :application, &quot;set your application name here&quot;
set :repository,  &quot;set your repository location here&quot;

# If you aren&#39;t deploying to /u/apps/#{application} on the target
# servers (which is the default), you can specify the actual location
# via the :deploy_to variable:
# set :deploy_to, &quot;/var/www/#{application}&quot;

# If you aren&#39;t using Subversion to manage your source code, specify
# your SCM below:
# set :scm, :subversion

role :app, &quot;your app-server here&quot;
role :web, &quot;your web-server here&quot;
role :db,  &quot;your db-server here&quot;, :primary =&gt; true</code></pre>

<p>But we&#8217;ll give it some lovin&#8217;:</p>

<pre><code>set :application, &quot;uber-mega-ultra-hyper&quot;
set :repository, &quot;git://github.com/you/uber-mega-ultra-hyper&quot;

set :deploy_to, &quot;/home/deploy/app&quot;
set :scm, :git

role :app, &quot;uber-mega-ultra-hyper.com&quot;
role :web, &quot;uber-mega-ultra-hyper.com&quot;
role :db, &quot;uber-mega-ultra-hyper.com&quot;, :primary =&amp;gt; true

namespace :passenger do
  task :restart do
    run &quot;touch #{current_path}/tmp/restart.txt&quot;
  end
end

# For deploying a database.yml file.
namespace :deploy do
 task :after_update_code, :roles =&gt; :app do
   run &quot;ln -nfs #{deploy_to}/shared/system/database.yml #{release_path}/config/database.yml&quot;
 end

after :deploy, &quot;passenger:restart&quot;</code></pre>
<br /><div>
<div class='note'><strong>Git Users:</strong> You'll need to run <span class='term'>apt-get install git-core</span> if you want to use git with Capistrano. Also, if you're wanting to deploy a branch it's best to specify a <span class='term'>set :branch, "your-branch"</span> in the <em>config/deploy.rb</em> file, otherwise Capistrano will checkout HEAD.

<strong>Subversion Users:</strong> You'll need to run <span class='term'>apt-get install subversion</span> if you want to use svn with Capistrano.</div>
</div>
<p>We&#8217;ve just changed all the default values to stuff that&#8217;s relevant to us, and removed all the comments from the file. The default scm for capistrano is SVN, but in this example we use git (shown as the repository URL and scm), so we have to set the scm to be git. Right at the end of the file we put in a small snippet of code that will restart passenger after we deploy. Simple really!</p>

<p>If you&#8217;re like me and you&#8217;ve ignored your config/database.yml file from your repository, you may want to create one. The great thing about Capistrano is that you can put files like this in a shared directory. I&#8217;ve put a database.yml file for my application in <em>/home/deploy/app/shared/system</em>. Right now, you wouldn&#8217;t have a /home/deploy/app/shared directory unless you created it so go right ahead now and create it using (while logged in as deploy): <span class='term'>~/app/shared/log ~/app/shared/system</span>. This command will also create the config, log and shared directories. Two of these directories, log and shared are symbollically linked from <em>current/log</em> to <em>shared/log</em> and <em>current/public/system</em> to <em>shared/system</em> respectively. Go ahead now and create your <em>shared/system/database.yml</em> file.</p>

<p>In your Rails application&#8217;s root directory, type <span class='term'>cap deploy</span> to put your application on the remote server. You may be prompted for a password. When that&#8217;s done, go have a look at your application and make sure everything is functioning correctly.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s all from the guide, I hoped you enjoyed it and learned something.</p>}]]></content>

   <updated>2008-08-29T00:00:00+10:00</updated>
   <id>http://ryanbigg.com/2008/08/a-sense-of-belonging</id>
   <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Numerous times I&#8217;ve needed and I&#8217;ve seen other people have needed the need to check whether an object belongs to the currently logged in user. I&#8217;ve worked out that something like this works: <pre class='markdown-html-error' style='border: solid 3px red; background-color: pink'>REXML could not parse this XML/HTML: 
&lt;pre lang=&quot;rails&quot;&gt;class User &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
  has_many :posts
  def owns?(object)
    object.user == self
  end
end&lt;/pre&gt;
This works when you have a currently logged in user and call it by using &lt;span class=&quot;term&quot;&gt;current_user.owns?(@post)&lt;/span&gt;. Now what if you wanted to do it the other way around? Well it&apos;s really as simple as this:
&lt;pre lang=&quot;rails&quot;&gt;class Post </pre></p>

<p>If you wanted to use either of these in the controller, it would be like this: <pre class='markdown-html-error' style='border: solid 3px red; background-color: pink'>REXML could not parse this XML/HTML: 
&lt;pre lang=&quot;rails&quot;&gt;class PostsController </pre></p>

<p>def update @post = Post.find(params<span>:id</span>) if current_user.owns?(@post) # or @post.belongs_to?(current_user) # carry on&#8230; if @post.update_attributes(params<span>:post</span>) flash<span>:success</span> = &#8220;Post updated!&#8221; redirect_to topic_path(@topic) else flash<span>:error</span> = &#8220;Post could not be updated.&#8221; render :action =&gt; &#8220;edit&#8221; end else flash<span>:error</span> = &#8220;You do not own that post.&#8221; end end</p>

<p>private def check_ownership if !current_user.owns?(@post) # or @post.belongs_to?(current_user) flash<span>:error</span> = &#8220;You do not own that post!&#8221; redirect_back_or_default topic_path(@topic) end end end&lt;/pre&gt; Now here we&#8217;ve called <span class='term'>check_ownership</span> in the edit action which will stop the template from being rendered by calling <span class='term'>redirect_back_or_default</span>. We can&#8217;t call (as I found out thanks to Blue_Sea) <span class='term'>check_ownership</span> in the same way in the update action because the code will still be executed. So we must call the methods we defined in the model, either <span class='term'>current_user.owns?(@post)</span> or <span class='term'>@post.belongs_to?(current_user)</span>.</p>}]]></content>

   <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Went to InLAN last night and it was great fun. Won the TF2 comp with Devastator, Insane Gazebo (aka Precious Pergola), Cadiniller and <a href='http://blog.thescream.org'>TheScream</a>, came second in Warsow (even though Devastator was so confident that was his place) and won a door prize of about 500g worth of chocolate.</p>

<p>Upon driving home <a href='http://maps.google.com/?ie=UTF8&ll=-34.799374,138.685559&spn=0.00548,0.011373&z=17'>on The Golden Way</a>, during very light showers on slippery road, a stoned pedestrian decides it an appropriate time to step out onto the road. Not only was he now ON the road, but my car was also ON the road and in the same lane. A short fight ensued between a 1-ton 70-kilometer per hour moving vehicle and a 90kg pedestrian in which the pedestrian destroyed the car&#8217;s front grill, dented the bumper and bonnet, rolled up the bonnet and proceeded to smash the bottom left hand corner of the windshield before bouncing off the car and onto the road to lay unconcious. All the while, Devastator&#8217;s screaming and I&#8217;m not too calm myself. Police arrived, ambos and fire crew too. Statements, blood alcohol readings (negative) and drug tests (<a href='http://www.flickr.com/photos/radarlistener/2778743437/'>negative also</a>) were taken. Hilarity did not ensue. It was cold. It was raining. It was not fun at all. I don&#8217;t recommend doing it. Pictures of my <a href='http://www.flickr.com/photos/radarlistener/sets/72157606637175442/'>now not-so-sweet ride can be found here</a>.</p>

<p>Some more information is: <ul>
<li>The police were apparently looking for a guy matching his description. I was never told why. Something about a petrol station.</li>
<li>He was unconscious after I hit him and still when I dragged him (and I've been told I wasn't supposed to do that) but seemed to be regaining consciousness when he was lifted into the ambulance.</li>
<li>He probably has a collapsed lung due to the impact and possible broken ribs (yes, plural)</li>
<li>I heard over the police radio mention of marijuana in relation to the description of the guy</li>
<li>My dashboard is now loose on the right, but nothing a little glue can't hold still</li>
<li>I'm fine, Devastator sounded a bit shaky still this afternoon</li>
<li>Thank you for your concern, especially Dad who didn't hesitate to come out and pick me up that late at night.</li>
</ul></p>

<p>So, tomorrow I&#8217;m taking the day off work and taking the car to get repaired. During the time of the day that I&#8217;m not getting the car repaired I&#8217;ll probably working. On what, we&#8217;ll have to decide tomorrow.</p>}]]></content>

<div class='quote'>
* You're familiar with Test/Behavior Driven Development and agile

<p>I have nothing witty to say about this.</p>

<div class='quote'>
* Production support and ticket management
</div>
<p>Ah, so the position is now more of a Software Engineer meet Tech Support meet Project Manager position now? Cool. Probably a bit overwhelming for one person (we have this in three separate roles @ <a href='http://www.netfox.com'>NetFox</a>)</p>

* Deployment management

   <title>Stop Being So Self-Centered!</title>
   <link href="http://ryanbigg.com/2008/07/stop-being-so-self-centered"/>
   <updated>2008-07-29T00:00:00+10:00</updated>
   <id>http://ryanbigg.com/2008/07/stop-being-so-self-centered</id>
   <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ve seen so many examples of people being self-centered in their code, always calling their methods on <span class='term'>self</span> when they don&#8217;t need to!</p>

<p>self is a handy reference to the current object (or class) depending on how the method is defined. In a class that inherits from ActiveRecord for example, calling self before defining a method will define that method on that class, rather than the objects of that class. Once inside of the method, you are free to go about as you will; Ruby will know what you mean when you call other methods inside that method.</p>

<p>A prime example would be this self-centered piece of code:</p>
<pre class='markdown-html-error' style='border: solid 3px red; background-color: pink'>REXML could not parse this XML/HTML: 
&lt;pre lang=&apos;rails&apos;&gt;
class Forum &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
  acts_as_tree
  
  def to_s
    self.title
  end
  
  def self.find_all_without_parent
    self.find_all_by_parent_id(nil)
  end
  
  def root
    self.parent.nil? ? self : self.parent
  end
  
end
&lt;/pre&gt;</pre>
<p>These are a few methods with both good and bad examples of using self.</p>

<p>We&#8217;ll start with <span class='term'>#to_s</span>. This method is defined by typing <span class='term'>def to_s</span>, which tells ruby we want to define a method called &#8220;to_s&#8221; on all objects of the Forum class. Inside the method however, we have a bad-case of self-centering, by calling self where it&#8217;s not needed. Ruby already knows that we&#8217;re operating with an object derived from the forum class, and calling self will only return the same object! So why do we do it here? We can remove the superfluous self call, and the method will still work.</p>

<p>Our next method is <span class='term'>self.find_all_without_parent</span>. The <span class='term'>self.</span> prefix to the method tells Ruby that we want to define this method on the Forum class itself, rather than a derived object from the class. Inside the method again we have a bad case of self-centering! Ruby already knows we&#8217;re operating with the Forum class, and calling self will only return the Forum class once more. Again we can remove the superfluous self call and the method will still work.</p>

<p>In both of these examples, you could&#8217;ve called self on self and then the method multiple times: <span class='term'>self.self.title</span> or even <span class='term'>self.self.self.self.self.title</span>, but that&#8217;s just going a bit overboard!</p>

<p>In the last method is two incorrect usages of self, and one correct use of self. The method is <span class='term'>#root</span>. The method defines a one-lined if statement by calling a method (<span class='term'>self.parent.nil?</span>) which will return either true or false. The next character is a space followed by a ?, which indicates to ruby anything after this is what we want executed when <span class='term'>self.parent.nil?</span> returns true. Here we just call <span class='term'>self</span>, and this is the good use of self. The <span class='term'>#root</span> method is attempting to find the root element for the tree heirachy of the forums, if the forum object we&#8217;re calling root does not have a parent, we want it to return itself as it is the highest level of the forum structure. The next character in the code is a colon (:), which tells Ruby what we want to do if <span class='term'>self.parent.nil?</span> returns false. Here we&#8217;ve called <span class='term'>self.parent</span>, which again is a superflous call to the self object. We only need to call parent because Ruby already knows which context we are referring to! The final superfluous self call is the <span class='term'>self.parent.nil?</span> from where our one-lined if statement originated.</p>

<p>I hope you&#8217;ve enjoyed this little tidbit, and please stop being so self-centered.</p>

<p>UPDATE: <a href='http://luckysneaks.com/blog'>RSL</a> has posted an easier way than <span class='term'>parent.nil? ? self : parent</span> as the first comment. The code is now simply:</p>
<pre lang='rails'>
def root
  parent || self
end
</pre>
<p>UPDATE #2: The root method was still broken as I realised this morning as I tampered with the tests. The method is supposed to get the highest forum in a string of forums. This works perfectly for 2-level-deep forums, but not for 3-level-deep. The third-level element would&#8217;ve returned the second-level element rather than the first. The revised code is now:</p>
<pre lang='rails'>
  def root
    parent.nil? ? self : (parent.root == parent ? parent : parent.root)
  end
</pre>}]]></content>

   <title>Rescue Correctly!</title>
   <link href="http://ryanbigg.com/2008/07/rescue-correctly"/>
   <updated>2008-07-28T00:00:00+10:00</updated>
   <id>http://ryanbigg.com/2008/07/rescue-correctly</id>
   <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Too many times I&#8217;ve seen people being over-zealous in rescuing their exceptions. They try doing something like this:</p>
<pre lang='rails'>
def show
  @forum = Forum.find(params[:id])
  rescue Exception
   flash[:notice] = 'The forum you were looking for does not exist'
end
</pre>
<p>Which will work when it can&#8217;t find a forum, and also when you have a typo. Exception the ancestor class of all other exceptions, and so every exception will trigger this rescue. Try making the code look like this:</p>
<pre lang='rails'>
def show
  @forum = Forum.find(params[:id)
  rescue Exception
    flash[:notice] = 'The forum you were looking for does not exist'
end
</pre>
<p>and you&#8217;ll wonder why a forum is telling you it doesn&#8217;t exist when it obviously does! The easiest way to fix this is to rescue correctly. By rescuing correctly, you prevent hours of potential headaches and your code becomes clearer to what it&#8217;s doing. In this example, when a forum object can&#8217;t be found it will raise the <span class='term'>ActiveRecord::RecordNotFound</span> exception, so this is what you should rescue.</p>
<pre lang='rails'>
def show
  @forum = Forum.find(params[:id])
  rescue ActiveRecord::RecordNotFound
    flash[:notice] = 'The forum you were looking for does not exist'
end
</pre>
<p>Another situation is when you&#8217;re using <span class='term'>#save!</span>. This &#8220;destructive&#8221; version of <span class='term'>#save</span> will raise an <span class='term'>ActiveRecord::RecordInvalid</span> or <span class='term'>ActiveRecord::RecordNotSaved</span>, depending on the kind of validations you have on your model. I use it here in this example:</p>
<pre lang='rails'>
def create
  @topic = @forum.topics.build(params[:topic])
  @post = @topic.posts.build(params[:post])
  @topic.save!
  flash[:notice] = 'Topic has been successfully created'
  rescue ActiveRecord::RecordNotSaved, ActiveRecord::RecordInvalid
    flash[:notice] = 'Topic could not be created'
  ensure
    redirect_to forum_topics_path(@forum)
end
</pre>
<p>I&#8217;ve actually specified two arguments to the rescue method here, the first is <span class='term'>ActiveRecord::RecordNotSaved</span>, and the next is <span class='term'>ActiveRecord::RecordInvalid</span>. The rescue method uses the splat operator (<em>), so it can take as many arguments as you can throw at it. I&#8217;ve also used another method here <span class='term'>ensure</span>. No matter how many exceptions get thrown, the code after the ensure statement will always be ran.</em></p>

<p>The final thing I would like to cover is rescuing two exceptions, but doing two different things.</p>
<pre lang='rails'>
def create
  @topic = @forum.topics.build(params[:topic])
  @post = @topic.posts.build(params[:post])
  @topic.save!
  flash[:notice] = 'Topic has been successfully created'
  rescue ActiveRecord::RecordNotSaved
    flash[:notice] = 'Topic could not be created, the record could not be saved'
  rescue ActiveRecord::RecordInvalid
    flash[:notice] = 'Topic could not be created, the record is invalid'
  ensure
    redirect_to forum_topics_path(@forum)
end
</pre>}]]></content>

   <title>What A Weekend!</title>

   <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>And it hasn&#8217;t even begun!</p>

<p>Here I sit on a Friday night, on my bed with two quilts over the lower-half of my body. Sitting by the open window (yes, open. Even though it&#8217;s winter and 7.7 celcius outside) on my bed with my laptop on top of the quilts. My mum&#8217;s boyfriend&#8217;s son sits on the only chair in the room, using UbrComputer and playing Spore Creature Creator, creating a dinosaur like creature. I feel relaxed, probably due to me getting off work a bit earlier than usual because the internet was balls (dialup had better ping times), and I know that there&#8217;s going to be a lot of stuff to do on the weekend.</p>

<p>Tomorrow I&#8217;m going to be attending <a href='http://avcon.org.au'>AVCon</a>, not because I like dressing up in a Sailor Moon costume (not that I&#8217;m going to of course), I just want to see what all the fuss is about. Two of my friends (Brenton and James) have both recommended in one way or another that I go, so I&#8217;m going. Hopefully I&#8217;ll enjoy myself, but it is an <b>anime</b> andvideogames conference, and I&#8217;m not all that in to anime&#8230;</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve been tasked (is this the correct word?) to host Railscamp #4! I have an idea for a venue and I&#8217;m going to check it out on Sunday. Hopefully if all goes according to plan there should be a formal announcement soonish. Price and what not is not worked out yet, but I have a good idea and I&#8217;m not going to tell you! I&#8217;ll have a better idea Sunday night, if I can be bothered blogging about it.</p>

<p>See you on the other side!</p>

<p>EDIT: I didn&#8217;t go to AvCon (thanks for answering my calls James!), instead I scoped out the venue for Railscamp #4, went cruising with Devastator in the epic quest for computer parts and generally lazed about like all decent people <span>should</span> do on a weekend.</p>}]]></content>

   <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today I was doing the one thing I truly, truly love doing and that&#8217;s complaining about writing RSpec tests. I came across a doozy of a problem involving RSpec testing and faking subdomains. Here&#8217;s a stripped down version of what I did:</p>
<pre lang='rails'>
def login_as(user)
  session["user"] = users(user).id
  request.host = User.find(session["user"]).company.domain + ".example.com"
end
</pre>
<p>Just pop that into your <em>spec/spec_helper.rb</em> and then you can use <span class='term'>login_as(:user)</span> which will find the fixture with the name of &#8220;user&#8221; and then go from there to setting your faked host as being from, for example, blah.example.com.</p>

<p>Pretty simple, shame Google didn&#8217;t turn up any relevant results without me having to dig deeper than usual.</p>}]]></content>

   <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Thanks to the guys at NetFox (Yuji or Adam) for the name for this post.</p>

<p>Tomorrow I go to the dentist to have empty wallet (read: root canal) treatment (hereafter referred to as EWT). My tooth that broke at Railscamp has a serious bout of decay in it no thanks to me not caring for my teeth as I really should have, for quite too long. Consider this a warning to all the readers of this blog to look after your teeth. It&#8217;s going to cost me a fair bit (thankfully I save money, rather than spend), and thanks to a complete lack of Dental insurance I&#8217;ll be paying through the nose (or is that the mouth?). I am not in any way looking foward to the needles (notice the plural!) that are going to be going into my gum tomorrow morning. The best part is that a client is coming in tomorrow at 10:30 and I&#8217;m one of the people working on their project, so I&#8217;ll be <span>attempting to</span> speak with them. Perhaps I could type and get the text-to-speech voice on the MBP to read it out, or something.</p>

<p>Look after your teeth, please. You are not invincible, and neither am I.</p>}]]></content>

   <title>RailsCamp '08 (#1?)</title>
   <link href="http://ryanbigg.com/2008/06/railscamp-08-1"/>
   <updated>2008-06-28T00:00:00+10:00</updated>
   <id>http://ryanbigg.com/2008/06/railscamp-08-1</id>
   <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I had an enjoyable weekend last weekend at Railscamp, and I had this whole 3-page summary written up for you readers but I&#8217;d figured I&#8217;d spare you that lengthy document (for now, ahahaha) . These are the things you need to know:</p>

<ol>
<li>It was held at Kariong (I kept calling it Kai-rong), about 6km from Gosford which itself is 1 hour and 30 minutes by train from Sydney. Scenic country-side, yada yada.</li>

<li>I am in love with Sydney trains. Flippable seats and no noisy engines.</li>

<li>The venue (one main hall, one &#8220;cafeteria&#8221; hall and two separate-but-joined domitories) was exceptional. We ran everything off a number of power points that you could count on one hand.</li>

<li>The people were exceptional. The talks were exceptional. Nothing beat Pat Allen&#8217;s talk (the very last one at Railscamp 2.0), and nothing will ever.</li>

<li>Yes Guitar Hero was played. Two <strong>and </strong>Three. Yes, I won. Yes, I&#8217;m a sore winner.</li>

<li>I also coded. Gitjour became a little weekend project and it was fun working on that with Lachlan Hardy, Tim Lucas, Dr. Nic &#38; Others.</li>

<li>Other applications included the ever-awesome Duke (Upload, Vote, Boogie), Swore-DS, and Pete Yandell&#8217;s proposal to create an application to track species in the wild.</li>

<li>Dr. Nic was obsessed with Cherry Pie. When he wasn&#8217;t playing it on Guitar Hero 2, he was humming/singing it.</li>

<li>The beds were creaky. Earplugs were my saviour.</li>

<li>Lachie had a machine that made him sound like Darth Vader whilst he slept. Very chilling. Earplugs helped here too.</li>

<li>There was a waterfall. We walked behind it. Then we bashed through the bush to camp.</li>

<li>Risked life / possible broken bones to climb a large rock face. using nothing but what nature provided. All this whilst trying to stop my camera from bashing against it. Then walked back to &#8220;camp&#8221;, only come out 500m away at the office. Stupid GPS!</li>

<li>Went away feeling fantastic.</li>
</ol>

<p>There was talk of possibly another Railscamp by the end of the year, or another one this time next year. I&#8217;m looking very much forward to it.</p>}]]></content>

   <title>A bit of refactoring love</title>
   <link href="http://ryanbigg.com/2008/06/a-bit-of-refactoring-love"/>
   <updated>2008-06-13T00:00:00+10:00</updated>
   <id>http://ryanbigg.com/2008/06/a-bit-of-refactoring-love</id>
   <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3>Find, Find, Find, Find, I don't think so...</h3>
<p>As explained in previous posts, Rails controllers have 7 default actions (index, new, create, show, edit, update, destroy). Four of these seven actions make the same find call, <span class='term'>Model.find(params[:id])</span> and this tutorial is to tidy that up so you&#8217;re not repeating yourself over four different actions. To clean this up we&#8217;ll just call a before filter:</p>
<pre class='markdown-html-error' style='border: solid 3px red; background-color: pink'>REXML could not parse this XML/HTML: 
&lt;pre lang=&apos;rails&apos;&gt;
class ForumsController &lt; ApplicationController
  before_filter :find_forum

  # Actions go here
  
  private
    def find_forum 
      @forum = Forum.find(params[:id])
    end
end
&lt;/pre&gt;</pre>
<p>Now you may be thinking, &#8220;Why are we doing that? That&#8217;s 5 lines!&#8221;. Think about if you wanted to change the find statement, and now you&#8217;ll begin to picture why. Changing one line is much easier than changing four. For example, if I wanted to find forums by their slugs instead of an ID I would simply change <span class='term'>@forum = Forum.find(params[:id])</span> to <span class='term'>@forum = Forum.find_by_slug(params[:id])</span>. Of course, for this to work with the restful routes helpers the way we expect it to (e.g. <span class='term'>forum_path(@forum)</span> -&gt; /forums/the-first-forum), we&#8217;ll need to re-define <span class='term'>#to_param</span> in our model:</p>
<pre lang='rails'>
class Forum
  def to_param
    slug
  end
end
</pre><h3>Common Lookups </h3>
<p>Sometimes you&#8217;ll have data initialised for your forms and you&#8217;ll want to initialise this data multiple times. Instead of repeating yourself like this:</p>
<pre lang='rails'>
class ForumsController

  def new
    @forum = Forum.new
    @something_special = SomethingSpecial.find(:all, :order => "id DESC")
  end
 
  def create
    @forum = Forum.new(params[:forum])
    if @forum.save
      flash[:success] = "A forum has been created."
      redirect_to @forum
    else
      flash[:failure] = "A forum could not be created."
      @something_special = SomethingSpecial.find(:all, :order => "id DESC")
      render :action => "new"
    end
  end

end
</pre>
<p>You could instead have:</p>
<pre lang='rails'>
class ForumsController

  def new
    @forum = Forum.new
    common_lookups
  end
 
  def create
    @forum = Forum.new(params[:forum])
    if @forum.save
      flash[:success] = "A forum has been created."
      redirect_to @forum
    else
      flash[:failure] = "A forum could not be created."
      common_lookups
      render :action => "new"
    end
  end

  private
    def common_lookups
      @something_special = SomethingSpecial.find(:all, :order => "id DESC")
    end
end
</pre><h3>Shorter Routing</h3>
<p>One last thing that I&#8217;d like to show you is shorter routing. Ever since the restful routing helpers were added, routing to specific controllers and their actions has become easier and easier. Rails 2.0 makes it extremely easy, but first we&#8217;ll see how far we&#8217;ve come: &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&#8217;term&#8217;&gt;&lt;%= link_to @forum, { :controller =&gt; &#8220;forums&#8221;, :action =&gt; &#8220;show&#8221;, :id =&gt; @forum.id } %&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&#8217;term&#8217;&gt;&lt;%= link_to @forum, forum_path(@forum) %&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&#8217;term&#8217;&gt;&lt;%= link_to @forum, forum_path %&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&#8217;term&#8217;&gt;&lt;%= link_to @forum, @forum %&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&#8217;term&#8217;&gt;&lt;%= link_to @forum %&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt;</p>

<p>As long as there&#8217;s a <span class='term'>#to_s</span> method in the Forum model it will insert that as the phrase shown to the user for the link. All of the above should produce the same URL, with the exception of the first which will produce <span class='term'>/forums/show/1</span>, and going down the list they&#8217;re just shorter ways of writing the same thing. If you had nested routes such as <span class='term'>forum_topic_path(@forum, @topic)</span> you could do <pre class='markdown-html-error' style='border: solid 3px red; background-color: pink'>REXML could not parse this XML/HTML: 
&lt;span class=&apos;term&apos;&gt;</pre></p>}]]></content>

   <title>SVN: Why I moved away, and why you should too</title>
   <link href="http://ryanbigg.com/2008/06/svn-why-i-moved-away-and-why-you-should-too"/>
   <updated>2008-06-07T00:00:00+10:00</updated>
   <id>http://ryanbigg.com/2008/06/svn-why-i-moved-away-and-why-you-should-too</id>
   <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>At my new work, we use SVN for all our projects, and we did the same thing at SeaLink too. The only difference being during that time in between SeaLink and NetFox, I was introduced to git.</p>

<p>Git is, in my opinion, a far superior &#8220;product&#8221; than SVN was, is or ever will be. It commits faster, it doesn&#8217;t whinge (read: completely block you from committing) when you manually rm directories instead of using their propriatary rm command, and you can type one command to add in all new files, all changed files and your commit message in one fell swoop.</p>

<p>Git is incredibly fast. If there was a race between the speed of light and git, git would win. I had a race between git and svn out of interest for a work project, work&#8217;s project took about<strong> 5 minutes</strong> to commit, whereas git took about <strong>30 seconds</strong>.</p>

<p>Need more reason? Okay then. Ever played around with svn propset in regards to setting svn:ignore. Ever realised how much of a pain in the ass it is? Me too! Wow. Git has this <strong>one file </strong>called .gitignore where you specify the relative path to the files to ignore. Say I have a log directory and I want all files in it with the extension .log. I would simply put &#8220;log/<em>.log&#8221; in my .gitignore file in the root of my project, and it would know what I&#8217;m talking about. &#8220;So what about two directories deep?&#8221;, I hear your nasily voice ask. Oh, that&#8217;s just log/</em><em>/</em>.log, effectively blocking any folder within the log (existing or not) from having any of their .log files commited.</p>

<p>But wait, there&#8217;s more!</p>

<p>Remember those .svn directories? Yeah, all of them. There&#8217;s only one for .git, and it&#8217;s kept right where you&#8217;d expect it, in the root directory of the project. This was one of my personal huge gripes with svn. When you&#8217;d delete a folder without doing svn rm, it would delete the .svn folder contained within it. So you&#8217;d go to commit it, and SVN would <strong>block your commit</strong>. You know what git does? Git <strong>tells you</strong> that the file is gone, <strong>but still lets you commit everything.</strong> Yeah, I know it&#8217;s awesome.</p>

<p>Tried merging and branching svn repositories? You&#8217;re right, painful is not the right term. Excruciating does not even come close. Git does this beautifully. Type &#8220;git branch experimental&#8221; and it&#8217;s there! Where experimental can be any name, I highly recommend naming them after characters from the Lord of the Rings series, or Star Wars. Wow, that was hard. Then you&#8217;ve got to checkout the new branch, &#8220;git checkout experimental&#8221;. Now I&#8217;m working on the new branch. No seperate folder containing the branch code, I don&#8217;t need one. Oh, and merging: &#8220;git merge &#8216;your message&#8217; head experimental&#8221;, and there you have it.</p>

<p>One final reason: Rails has moved away from SVN to git. Many rails plugins have also moved away. I personally hope SVN will die a quick and painful death, to be replaced with a better SCM.</p>}]]></content>

   <id>http://ryanbigg.com/2008/06/which-came-first</id>
   <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today a question was asked by the work experience kid that made me think what in Ruby gets called first, a local variable or a method. The answer can be explained by this short irb example (thanks to Yuji Yukoo, a work mate of mine):</p>
<pre lang='rails'>
irb(main):001:0> a = "b"
=> "b"
irb(main):002:0> def a
irb(main):003:1> "a"
irb(main):004:1> end
=> nil
irb(main):005:0> a
=> "b"
irb(main):006:0> a()
=> "a"
</pre>
<p>Firstly we define a local variable called a, and then a method called a, and then we type a and press enter, and the local variable is outputted rather than the method. Next we call a() which outputs &#8220;a&#8221;, the code defined within the method a. It&#8217;s just one of those interesting things of note.</p>}]]></content>

   <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>So today as a kind of a reward for working hard and kind of I&#8217;ve always wanted one, I bought myself a MacBook Pro. It&#8217;s a 15.4&#8221;, 2.4ghz, yada yada, brand new MacBook Pro.</p>

<p>I took the train in to town (after being placed on hold for 10 minutes) and, thanks to Google Maps&#8217;s wonderful position of Next Byte (saying it was on the southern side of Rundle Mall when it was actually on the northern side), I accidentally stumbled into the store whilst looking for it. The guy who served me was more than happy to go upstairs and get one&#8230; but when he returned the serial number didn&#8217;t match. So he went to get another&#8230; and the serial number still didn&#8217;t match! Each time taking about 3 minutes. Third time lucky, he came back and said &#8220;I know this is in the system&#8221;, and I bought it on the spot.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s now two hours after I&#8217;ve gotten home. It was weird at first having a perfectly good computer in front of me and not knowing what to do with it, but once you play around with it for a little while things (simple and not so simple) become obvious. The dock is probably my favourite feature so far, even if I did have to make it about 33% of it&#8217;s original size. I&#8217;ve also managed to install Git!</p>

<p></p>

<p>The downloads box is another good feature, but it needs some more notification, like what the Colloquy window has when someone says your name. I love the way you install programs, so non-fuss. I click once on the downloaded file and it&#8217;s already there for me to use.</p>

<p>If the ambient light is bright enough, the keyboard keys are not illuminated and the screen gets brighter automatically so you can see in lighter conditions. There is a certain limit to how dark the screen gets, so you&#8217;re not going to be adjusting the brightness if you&#8217;re sitting in a dark cave somewhere.</p>

<p>The magnetic power plug is good too, and I know full well the damage that can be caused to a laptop when you trip over a cord that&#8217;s plugged into one; I recently destroyed the headphone socket when I tripped over the cord coming out of my Toshiba laptop. I know that if I trip over the Mac&#8217;s power cord, it should come out right away. The annoying thing I find about it is the light&#8230; but I guess I&#8217;ll get used to that.</p>

<p>The terminal was originally hard to find (I am/was/will be a Mac Noob), but eventually I did. I love how the commands are so unix like, such as sudo to do stuff as root and&#8230; just about any unix command you can think of.</p>

<p>Another nice touch is having the menu bar at the very top of the screen rather than the application, so whatever application you&#8217;re in it&#8217;s always in the same spot and generally the menus seem to be laid out the same way.</p>

<p>One last thing, <em>everything</em> looks so god damned shiny. It&#8217;s awesome. The fonts are all anti-aliased (except the terminal&#8217;s by default, not too hard to change) and the buttons all have that classic Mac styling we&#8217;ve come to love and envy.</p>

<p>All in all, a very nice system and worth the money.</p>

   <title>Updating a select box based on another</title>
   <link href="http://ryanbigg.com/2008/05/updating-a-select-box-based-on-another"/>
   <updated>2008-05-20T00:00:00+10:00</updated>
   <id>http://ryanbigg.com/2008/05/updating-a-select-box-based-on-another</id>
   <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In two projects now I&#8217;ve had to use code where I update a select box (machines) in regards to what&#8217;s selected in the first (customers). mark<span>oz</span> from #rubyonrails asked how to do this last week and I told him I would write a blog post the following night. 5 days later, here it is.</p>

<p>I use this when I&#8217;m creating a new call and the user needs to select which customer and then which machine. I have the following in my CallsController: <pre lang='rails'>def new
  @call = Call.new
  @customers = Customer.find(:all, :order => "name ASC")
end</pre> Relatively simple. We instantiate a new call object so the form knows where to go, and we define <span class='term'>@customers</span> so the first select box has some information.</p>

<p>Of course in our Customer model we have: <pre class='markdown-html-error' style='border: solid 3px red; background-color: pink'>REXML could not parse this XML/HTML: 
&lt;pre lang=&quot;rails&quot;&gt;class Customer &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
  has_many :machines
end&lt;/pre&gt;
And the machine model:
&lt;pre lang=&quot;rails&quot;&gt;class Machine &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
  belongs_to :customer
end&lt;/pre&gt;
And the call model:
&lt;pre lang=&quot;rails&quot;&gt;class Call &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
  belongs_to :machine
  belongs_to :customer
&lt;/pre&gt;</pre></p>

<p>These define the relationships used within the system.</p>

<p>Next is the <span class='term'>new.html.erb</span> page itself. <pre class='markdown-html-error' style='border: solid 3px red; background-color: pink'>REXML could not parse this XML/HTML: 
&lt;pre lang=&quot;rails&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New Call&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;% form_for @call do |f| %&gt;
  &lt;%= render :partial =&gt; &quot;form&quot; %&gt;
  &lt;%= submit_tag &quot;Create&quot; %&gt;
&lt;% end %&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
And a stripped-down version of the form partial:
&lt;pre lang=&quot;rails&quot;&gt;&lt;%= f.label &quot;customer_id&quot; %&gt;
&lt;%= f.select &quot;customer_id&quot;, @customers.map { |c| [c.name, c.id] }%&gt;
&lt;%= observe_field &quot;call_customer_id&quot;, :url =&gt; by_customer_machines_path, :with =&gt; &quot;customer_id&quot; %&gt;
&lt;%= f.label &quot;machine_id&quot; %&gt;
&lt;%= f.select &quot;machine_id&quot;, &quot;Please select a customer&quot; %&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
Right now that we have the form all set up, lets set up our machines controller
&lt;pre lang=&quot;rails&quot;&gt;class MachinesController </pre></p>

<h1 id='crud_operations_go_here'>CRUD operations go here</h1>

<p>def by_customer @machines = Machine.find_all_by_customer_id(params<span>:customer_id</span>) end end&lt;/pre&gt; And our <span class='term'>by_customer.rjs</span>: <pre lang='rails'>page.replace_html 'call_machine_id', options_from_collection_for_select(@machines, "id", "name")</pre> And finally the config/routes.rb: <pre class='markdown-html-error' style='border: solid 3px red; background-color: pink'>REXML could not parse this XML/HTML: 
&lt;pre lang=&quot;rails&quot;&gt;map.resources :customers do |customer|
  customer.resources :machines
end</pre></p>

<p>map.resources :machines, :collection =&gt; { :by_customer =&gt; :post }&lt;/pre&gt; Now when we select a customer from the top drop down, the machines drop down should be populated too.</p>}]]></content>

   <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We (me, Paul, Thomo, Kellow, Steve and Cam) had another RadarLAN on the weekend and it was so much fun killing you all in CoD4 by calling in airstrikes and helicopters and accusing (rightfully!)

This means the next one would&#8217;ve been on the 21st June, but I&#8217;ll be camping it up in Sydney then, so instead it will be on the 14th June.</p>

<p>Consider this your three weeks notice! No excuses that you didn&#8217;t get the notification, because you should&#8217;ve read my blog, like all the good other people!</p>

   <title>ActiveResource & ZenDesk</title>
   <link href="http://ryanbigg.com/2008/05/activeresource-zendesk"/>
   <updated>2008-05-14T00:00:00+10:00</updated>
   <id>http://ryanbigg.com/2008/05/activeresource-zendesk</id>
   <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>With many, many thanks to Frederick Cheung, who without this would&#8217;ve been way more painful and time-consuming. My original question and our discussion can be found <a href='http://groups.google.ca/group/rubyonrails-talk/browse_thread/thread/49616be220fb8d1d'>here</a>.</p>

<p>At my new job we signed up with <a href='http://zendesk.com'>ZenDesk</a>, which acts as our helpdesk/ticketing system for our clients who sign up to our site and buy our product. Because ZenDesk uses emails instead of plain ol&#8217; usernames for authentication, Ruby chucked a fit when we tried doing stuff like: <pre lang='rails'>class User &lt; ActiveResource::Base
self.site = "http://ouremail@ourwebsite.com:ourpassword@ourplace.zendesk.com"
end</pre> Ruby&#8217;s URI class just didn&#8217;t like that first @ sign in there! So Fred originally recommended we try to encode it, %40. That didn&#8217;t work. Then the next morning Fred suggests doing this: <pre class='markdown-html-error' style='border: solid 3px red; background-color: pink'>REXML could not parse this XML/HTML: 
&lt;pre lang=&quot;rails&quot;&gt;class User &amp;lt; ActiveResource::Base
self.site = &quot;http://ourplace.zendesk.com&quot;</pre></p>

<p>def (self.site).user &#8220;ouremail@ourwebsite.com&#8221; end</p>

<p>def (self.site).password &#8220;ourpassword&#8221; end</p>

<p>end&lt;/pre&gt; And &#8216;lo and behold the thing worked!</p>

<p>So for all you savvy kids using Rails&#8217; ActiveResource and trying to make it play nice with ZenDesk, that&#8217;s how we did it.</p>

<p>Then I went a little further with the refactoring and just made a ZenDesk model: <pre class='markdown-html-error' style='border: solid 3px red; background-color: pink'>REXML could not parse this XML/HTML: 
&lt;pre lang=&quot;rails&quot;&gt;class ZenDesk &amp;lt; ActiveResource::Base</pre></p>

<p>self.site = &#8220;http://ourplace.zendesk.com&#8221;</p>

<p>def (self.site).user &#8220;ouremail@ourwebsite.com&#8221; end</p>

<p>def (self.site).password &#8220;ourpassword&#8221; end</p>

<p>end end&lt;/pre&gt; And then got the models I wanted to inherit from that. <pre lang='rails'>class User &lt; ZenDesk
end</pre> Brilliant!</p>

<p>Also one more note. If you&#8217;re going through and testing out creating Organisations/Users in ZenDesk through ActiveResource, don&#8217;t forget to delete them as you go! It&#8217;s time-consuming clicking edit, and then the delete button for 50 odd objects&#8230; but of course you could do this: <pre lang='ruby'>for i in original_object_id..last_object_id
User.find(i).destroy
end</pre> Which, if you did it, say, all in the same day like I did, should delete all the users within that range.</p>}]]></content>

<p>Not only was it that song on Nova, but it was around a second past where I was just humming it. Freaky.</p>

<p>Also a few years ago, at a family gathering and after Grandad had passed away, the conversation changed topic to his girlfiend, Shirley. No one had heard from her for at least a year, and a few people said they&#8217;d seen her in the shops. During this conversation, Aunty Eileen gets a call on her mobile and we joke &#8220;Oh that&#8217;ll be Shirley&#8221;.

   <title>Self-Referential Relationships</title>
   <link href="http://ryanbigg.com/2008/04/self-referrential-relationships"/>
   <updated>2008-04-29T00:00:00+10:00</updated>
   <id>http://ryanbigg.com/2008/04/self-referrential-relationships</id>
   <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ve seen this question asked time and time again, so I&#8217;m going to write a short tutorial about how to do it. The question is self-refferential relationships for a model, often the User model to determine the relationship between two different users. I&#8217;ll assume that you&#8217;ve already got a Rails application and at least a User model for this. We&#8217;ll use a has_many :through relationship to define which users are related to who.</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s generate a model for the relationship: <span class='term'>script/generate model relationship</span>. This will generate a migration which we&#8217;ll create our relationships table with.</p>
<strong class='code-title'>db/migrate/xxx_create_relationships.rb</strong><pre class='markdown-html-error' style='border: solid 3px red; background-color: pink'>REXML could not parse this XML/HTML: 
&lt;pre lang=&quot;rails&quot;&gt;class CreateRelationships &lt; ActiveRecord::Migration
  def self.up
    create_table :relationships do |t|
      t.integer :user_id, :friend_id
      t.string :relationship_type
    end
  end

  def self.down
    drop_table :relationships
  end
end&lt;/pre&gt;
And that should do us. Run &lt;span class=&quot;term&quot;&gt;rake db:migrate&lt;/span&gt; to add the table in.

Now we go into our User model and we add in the following:

&lt;strong class=&quot;code-title&quot;&gt;app/models/user.rb&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;pre lang=&quot;rails&quot;&gt;class User &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
  has_many :relationships
  has_many :friends, :through =&gt; :relationships
end&lt;/pre&gt;
And in our relationship.rb model:

&lt;strong class=&quot;code-title&quot;&gt;app/models/user.rb&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;pre lang=&quot;rails&quot;&gt;class Relationship &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
  belongs_to :friend, :class_name =&gt; &quot;User&quot;
  belongs_to :user
end&lt;/pre&gt;
And now we see if it works:

&lt;strong class=&quot;code-title&quot;&gt;script/console&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;pre lang=&quot;rails&quot;&gt;&gt;&gt; u = User.find_by_name(&quot;Ryan&quot;)
=&gt; #
&gt;&gt; u.friends &lt;&lt; User.find_by_name(&quot;Charlie&quot;)
=&gt; #
&gt;&gt; u.save
=&gt; true&lt;/pre&gt;
Now what if we want to change that relationship field? We&apos;ll add in two methods in to the user model to find the relationship for a specific user.

&lt;strong class=&quot;code-title&quot;&gt;app/models/user.rb&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;pre lang=&quot;rails&quot;&gt;def to_i
  id
end

def find_relationship_with(user)
  Relationship.find_by_friend_id(user.to_i)
end&lt;/pre&gt;
The first method, &lt;span class=&quot;term&quot;&gt;to_i&lt;/span&gt;, will return just the id for the user. The reason why we do this is because in the next method, &lt;span class=&quot;term&quot;&gt;find_relationship_with&lt;/span&gt; we pass in a single argument, user. Now because we&apos;ve defined the to_i method on our User model, this means we can either pass in a user id or a user object to this method, and it will call to_i on whatever we pass in, ending up with an id. When the method&apos;s done, it will return a relationship object which you can then modify.

Best of luck.</pre>}]]></content>

   <title>Windows XP Service Pack 3 Overview Overview</title>
   <link href="http://ryanbigg.com/2008/04/windows-xp-service-pack-3-overview-overview"/>
   <updated>2008-04-28T00:00:00+10:00</updated>
   <id>http://ryanbigg.com/2008/04/windows-xp-service-pack-3-overview-overview</id>
   <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>After seeing <a href='http://www.forgedeuphoria.com/blog/2008/04/xp-sp3-the-good-the-bad-and-the-ugly/'>aeriff's article on Windows XP Service Pack 3</a> I decided to take a gander at what went in to it. <a href='http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=68c48dad-bc34-40be-8d85-6bb4f56f5110&amp;displaylang=en'>Thankfully Microsoft has a handy .pdf detailing it</a> (with awesome pictures!), scroll down to &#8220;Files in this download&#8221; and click the download button, because Microsoft is too stupid to make sites where you can link directly to their downloads.</p>

<p>First thing you&#8217;ll see when you open up this marvel of a document is the Windows XP Professional logo, complete with not only reflected text, but reflected text in a gradient. How Web 2.0. Too bad they didn&#8217;t improve the pixellated logo. It gives you a short abstract of what it contains (not like the title didn&#8217;t already do that!), and then you move on to the next page.</p>

<p>You could read the whole legal blurb and let your mind melt at the words within it, but I&#8217;d recommend skipping this.</p>

<p>Oh look, an index! A whole 10 pages!</p>

<p>And now we get to the Introduction. The introduction explains how Microsoft so awesomely works incredibly hard to improve their operating system (and I don&#8217;t doubt they do). You can read how apparently awesome Microsoft is (and I don&#8217;t doubt they aren&#8217;t&#8230; in their own minds), or you can direct your gaze over to the awesome funnel on the right hand side. Here we have three spheres, done up in what appears to be Fireworks or Photoshop, coloured purple, green and red and complete with stroke, inner shadow (actually, it&#8217;s bevel &#38; emboss) and drop shadow. Then we have the <em>piece de resistance</em>, the funnel itself. A very light blue with a thick darker blue stroke and an even thicker (but less opaque) black outer glow. What a work of art! Let&#8217;s not forget the arrow, which is quite obviously bevelled and embossed, pointing to the large text Service Pack. Finally, to make the whole diagram look almost 3d there&#8217;s a very fainy shadow for the funnel, beginning at the base of the funnel to the top of the &#8220;Service Pack&#8221; text. This should be hanging in the Louvre.</p>

<p>On the next page we are not blessed with such fantastic artwork as the Funnel of Updates, but instead we&#8217;re given another huge block of text. It mentions that it does not upgrade it to Vista (duh, that would not cost the consumer money), and does not include IE7, which I found interesting since I believe this was initially released through the automatic updating process. Perhaps Microsoft actually listened to the Mozilla Foundation/Opera/elinks? It links you to a knowledge base article <a href='http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=103822'>#936929. </a></p>

<p>The next few pages lists what&#8217;s been introduced into Windows XP through updates. WPA2 is something that caught my eye, and absolutely everything else on this first page seemed to be wankery.&#8217;</p>

<p>The next page I wanted to look at was page 8, with the huge dialog box open showing how well the Administrator account local security settings is now documented, which it probably should&#8217;ve been before the OS was released. Now anyone playing around with this option should either 1) know the consequences if they mess it up and 2) know what they want to know&#8230; making this document irrelevant. And it even links you to an on-site address, purportedly giving you more information about the setting.</p>

<p>You don&#8217;t have to provide a product key when upgrading, but it will install the &#8220;Genuine Advantage&#8221; tool, by the look of things.</p>

<p>Won&#8217;t be something I&#8217;m installing any time soon, I&#8217;m running Ubuntu :)</p>}]]></content>

   <title>And We're Back... For Another Year</title>
   <link href="http://ryanbigg.com/2008/04/and-were-back-for-another-year"/>
   <updated>2008-04-22T00:00:00+10:00</updated>
   <id>http://ryanbigg.com/2008/04/and-were-back-for-another-year</id>
   <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>After a monumental fuck-around by Telstra, I have an internet connection. Whilst I was being fucked around the domain expired so you all saw that pretty page. Here&#8217;s a little rant I wrote when I didn&#8217;t have any internet:</p>
<blockquote>On the 10th March, this year, I phoned up <a href='http://www.adam.com.au'>Adam Internet</a> and signed up with them, and then gave TPG the required 4-weeks notification that I wanted to disconnect from them, which I thought was bullshit, but it needed to be done so I could get better internet speed: 24mbits from Adam compared with the 1.5mbits from TPG.

So the 10th April rolled around nice and quickly, and kind of snuck up on me. I was under the impression that I cancelled it for the <b>11th</b> and not the 10th. I only realised this when my internet was disconnected at about 8:45am on the 10th. Within minutes (or seconds?) I was bored out of my fucking mind. I couldn't do anything. I couldn't google how to make Ruby and MYOB play nicely, I couldn't even go to whitepages.com.au to look up the number for GameTraders. Fantastic.

Then I remembered that, usually, when ISPs set up new connections for you that they send you out a router. Adam didn't do, and still hasn't done, this. I paid for the router ($199.95) so in legal terms I do believe that makes it mine, regardless of what they told me next when I phoned them on the Friday (11th).

After a 10 minute wait on the phone listening to their awesome soundtrack selection and all the hyped up paid-to-tell-you-how-awesome-Adam-supposedly-is telling me how awesome Adam supposedly is, I get answered by a <b>real person</b>, Jarred. He tells me that "there are still codes on your line" and that "we don't send out routers until we make sure the connection works, so we don't have to chase up <b>our</b> routers". I'm drawn into a stupor. I ask him when the connection will be up and he tells me "<b>5-10 business days</b> from the day the codes are removed from your line". I paid for the router, it should've arrived <b>a few days after I had paid for it</b>, that is if I'm not mistaken about how the whole buying things over the internet works. I thank him for his time, hang up and get a little frustrated as I'm sure most of you would too, realising you had no internet for the next 5, possibly 10, business days. The internet is where I work, and without the internet I don't get any money because I simply cannot do a large portion of my work without it.

On Monday I phoned up JustComputing to organise a server for SA Window Cleaning, the client that I'm currently working for. I give them the specifications and tell them that there's no rush on it. It was ready on Wednesday, and that's a good thing. It took them 2 days to source the parts, build the box, install Windows XP on it (I'll be removing this) and get me to come and pick it up.

Now tell me why it takes a Goliath-sized organisation 9 days to move a cable from one box to another, which is probably all it takes in regards to my internet connection, yet a small 5-man computer store can make a new computer for me in two days.

This is the strangeness of time, and I have a theory about it. The larger the company, the longer it takes for something to get done. Let's use Telstra as an example. They have the money, manpower and equipment to do a lot of things that they simply haven't done because they couldn't care less, and it is not critical to their survival in order to do these things. One of them is to roll out decent broadband (at least 256k) to the people living in the hills, such as my friend Joe who is still on dialup, <b>in 2008</b>. It's not critical to Telstra's survival to do this. It's also due to the levels of bureaucracy that a thing-to-do needs to go through. In Telstra you'll have the callcenter minion, and then his boss, her boss, his boss... and so on.

Now lets take a small operation like JustComputing, where every customer is critical to their survival. They will get things done because if they don't get things done it means they don't get any money. They get things done quickly, efficiently and without fucking you around with bullshit excuses like "there are codes on your line". In JustComputing, <b>if</b> something needs approval there's one level of bureaucracy to go through, and that's just the one boss. Everyone reports to the same guy and most of the guys can operate independently of him.

I don't know where or when a big business crosses this line of no longer caring, but it's crap. You should treat everyone equally, from your employees, right down to their minions and then the customers, the critical part of your business. Making them wait on the phone is only going to piss them off. They will not be reasonable when you pick up the phone. Do you have long wait times for your customers? Hire more people. The more customers walking out of your store with a smile on their face and nothing in their wallet means more in your wallet and a bigger smile on your face at the end of the day, partly due to you not having to deal with stressed out customers. Treat your last customer like you treated your first, and you'll succeed.</blockquote>
<p>Whilst not having the internet for 12 days, I wrote some more of a tutorial, worked on SA Window Cleaning (mentioned above, and now at the point where I&#8217;m ready to give it to them) and got really, really, really good at Guitar Hero.</p>

<p>Oh, and the router still hasn&#8217;t arrived.</p>}]]></content>

   <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A friend asked if I wanted to go to a party and I 202, and said 200. When we got there I asked for a glass of water, only to be given a 400 instead. So I asked for a Coke and the reply was 402, so I 202.</p>

<p>My phone rang but all I got was 206, thanks to the totally rad phone coverage in the venue. So I limited myself talking to people around me. Ended up talking my friend&#8217;s girlfriend who complained about her boyfriend&#8217;s 411 (or possible 410), and her suspicions he may be 101. I mentioned about my 413 and she gave back 402. The boyfriend overheard and we got into a 409, he said what I was doing was 406 (or was that 405?). He said that he&#8217;d be 303&#8217;ing from now on, and she said she&#8217;d already 302 another. I said that I had 300, to which she shrugged.</p>

<p>I grabbed some appetisers from a passing tray, only for later on that night to have a 500 and I 502&#8217;d the appetisers. The party was a 417!</p>

   <updated>2008-04-07T00:00:00+10:00</updated>
   <id>http://ryanbigg.com/2008/04/epic-fail-from-epic</id>
   <content type="html"><![CDATA[<pre lang='ruby'>"The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog".split("").each do |a|
string &lt;&lt; "0" if a[0] &lt; 100
string += a[0].to_s &lt;&lt; "000"
end</pre>
<p>The above code is probably similar to what Epic uses to generate the server descriptions of their UT3 servers. My friend Devastator ranted about how bad these servers were to configure, thanks mainly to the ServerDescription and the insanely crappy way of configuring the entire server, containing the whole configuration in a .bat file (see bottom of post)</p>

<p>So I begun to write him a ruby program that would do it. At the top of the post is my code that works out the correct server description code for UT3 servers. What almost <strong>looks like UTF16</strong> is actually anything but. Let&#8217;s go through what it does: <ol>
	<li>Iterates through all the characters and does this:</li>
	<li>Finds the ascii value.</li>
	<li>If the ascii value is less than 100, it will add a zero (0) to the string.</li>
	<li>It then adds the ascii value to the string.</li>
	<li>It then adds three zeroes (000) to the string.</li>
	<li>Repeat until all characters are done.</li>
</ol> Then it gives you something like this:</p>

<p>084000104000101000032000113000117000105000099000107000032000098 000114000111000119000110000032000102000111000120000032000106000 117000109000112000101000100000032000111000118000101000114000032 000116000104000101000032000108000097000122000121000032000100000 111000103000</p>

<p>I added line breaks so it wouldn&#8217;t break my blog. Did I mention the whole config file has to be on one line? No? Well guess what? It HAS to be on one line, else you break it. Want to know what it looks like? <pre>D:
cd "Games\Unreal Tournament 3\Binaries\"start UT3.exe server DM-Deck?Game=UTGame.UTDuelGame?GameMode=0?minnetplayers=2?maxplayers=2?
mutator=utcomp3v02b.UTMutator_utcomp3v02b?PureServer=0?timelimit=10?goalscore=0?

   <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p style='text-align: left;'>Wow, three Rails-related posts in a row. Sorry for people reading this blog for other things :)</p><p style='text-align: left;'>Today's handy hint is how to get a local copy of all the gems on Rubyforge, so if you want them they're right there and ready to go. Handy if you don't have an internet connection.</p><pre lang='bash'>#!/bin/bash
sudo wget http://gems.rubyforge.org/yaml -O yaml
sudo rsync -avu rsync://rubyforge.rubyuser.de/gems gems</pre>
<p>is the code I use. I put it in a file called update_gems in my /var/www directory (default root dir for Apache on Ubuntu) and<em> chmod +x </em>it. From there, I run it and it firstly downloads the yaml file from gems.rubyforge.org containing the specification of all gems, and then synchronises the gems folder with the remote gem repositoy hosted at http://rubyforge.rubyuser.de.</p>

<p>So simple, so elegant, and so fast (apart from the initial multi-gigabyte download).</p>

<p>I keep a copy on my laptop.</p>}]]></content>

   <title>Rails 2.1: Migration Timestamping</title>
   <link href="http://ryanbigg.com/2008/04/rails-21-migration-timestamping"/>
   <updated>2008-04-03T00:00:00+10:00</updated>
   <id>http://ryanbigg.com/2008/04/rails-21-migration-timestamping</id>
   <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Rails 2.1 is right around the corner, and with it come a few new changes, and one of them is migration timestamping. Instead of adding a number before the migration, for example <em><strong>001</strong>_create_forums.rb, </em>it now adds a UTC timestamp before it, for example <em><strong>20080403021817</strong>_create_forums.rb</em>.</p>

<p>Now, you may think this is a good idea because it will stop the problem of conflicting version numbers on migrations when two developers are working on the same thing, which happens frequently and even there were a few cases at SeaLink where we had this problem and spent some time sorting it out. With the new timestamping it requires that two developers create migrations at precisely the same second, which is less common to happen than creating migrations with the same version number.</p>

<p>But then we get to the tab-completion. Many developers use the console to do their work, or to make small changes to migrations quickly and easily. Tab-completion is a lifesaver and it fills out the name for you. If you were using vim.ruby and the current version of rails, you would type <em>:e </em>to open the file (assuming you&#8217;re already in db/migrate) and type 001 and press tab, it would auto complete the name and you can carry on your merry way. Now think if you created two migrations, each 5 minutes apart on this new Rails 2.1 system. You would have to first type <em>:e </em>and then 200804030220 and then &#60;tab&#62; to get it to tab complete, which is a pretty large number to remember.</p>

<p>I myself don&#8217;t mind this new change, as I open migrations using Netbeans 99% of the time. There was a lot of heated debate on this in #rubyonrails recently, and there was little talk on <a href='http://dev.rubyonrails.org/ticket/11458'>the actual ticket</a> which was accepted rather quickly; not that I&#8217;m saying that&#8217;s a bad thing. <a href='http://dev.rubyonrails.org/changeset/9122'>The changeset is also available.</a></p>}]]></content>

<p>Let&#8217;s move right on to the person who, if we got this job, we would be reporting to: &#8220;Director of Web, Creative, and Technology&#8221;. What&#8217;s that saying? The longer the title the smaller the intelligence? Something like that. I&#8217;ve never met the guy (or girl), so I can&#8217;t pass judgement. It&#8217;s just a long title; &#8220;Lead Developer&#8221; is fine, really.</p>

<p>It moves on to say that you should be able to build &#8220;prototypes&#8221; and &#8220;wireframes&#8221;, which could mean anything, for example: elaborate real-life models of how all your tables interconnect, kind of like people doing degrees in Science have the models of molecules and so on.</p>

<p>The first two points in the qualifications are fine, &#8220;knowledge of unix development&#8221; (pay attention to this first one) and &#8220;ability to write clean code&#8221;, but the third gets a little funky: <blockquote>Familiar with Apache, SSH, SVN and CVS</blockquote> Why the need to have familiarity with SVN <strong>and</strong> CVS? Surely all the projects would be kept on one (SVN, I hope) rather than the other.</p>

<p>It continues on listing the obviously needed skills, such as experience in Ruby on Rails (why would you advertise on rubyonrails-talk if you were looking for a Cobol developer?) It uses a whole string of long words in order to make the qualifications more than what they seem, but in reality all you&#8217;ll need is some decent understanding of Ruby on Rails, MySQL and Apache, and lets not forget the obvious Three Big Ones, HTML, CSS and JavaScript.</p>

<p>It mentions in there also about being aware of accessibility issues, which is fine if you&#8217;re going to have people with a disability accessing your site, which I&#8217;m assuming they&#8217;re going to do. Just, don&#8217;t go over the top with this. I once saw a site which had a small video of a woman translating the page&#8217;s text into sign language.</p>

<p>Now remember before how I said to pay attention to the fact that they said &#8220;knowledge of unix development&#8221;? Well in this next set of text &#8220;Plus Factors&#8221;, it says &#8220;experience with TextMate, Transmit&#8221; both of which are Mac programs. Mac is part-Unix as well, but that wasn&#8217;t stated in the initial briefing that development would be being done on Macs, and I feel that would&#8217;ve been handy to point out from the offset, not that developing on Macs is at all a bad idea. TextMate apparently kicks the ass of anything else out there, I&#8217;m yet to try it.</p>

<p>It still bugs me that they didn&#8217;t name the company, although I can guess out of the very limited number of &#8220;World Famous Cutting Edge&#8221; companies around, that it might be&#8230;</p>}]]></content>

   <title>Crash Repairers</title>
   <link href="http://ryanbigg.com/2008/03/crash-repairers"/>
   <updated>2008-03-28T00:00:00+10:00</updated>
   <id>http://ryanbigg.com/2008/03/crash-repairers</id>
   <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>On the 5th of January this year, Daniel Thorpe hit my car with his car. He backed into it from about 15m away, whilst backing out of a driveway. He didn&#8217;t bother turning the wheel because that&#8217;s just retarded. I covered what happened in my &#8221;<a href='http://frozenplague.net/2008/01/07/the-weekend-from-hell/'>Weekend From Hell</a>&#8221; post, a couple of days after the event.</p>

<p>Eventually, around Feburary, I started talking to the insurance company. This was in part due to Daniel and my identically superior abilities at procrastinating.</p>

<p>On the 26th of March, I finally managed to get it to a crash repairer after waiting for about 3 weeks after initial contact with the crash repairer, due to them being &#8220;busy&#8221;.</p>

<p>I rock up with my car at 10am and they&#8217;re all sitting outside having a smoko. I leave them my car, and they say it will take them 2 days, and off I walked all the way back home (catching a train in between Salisbury and Elizabeth).</p>

<p>Today I phone them up asking when my car will be ready, to which they reply <strong>any time between 4:30 and 5pm</strong>. I accept this, and find out what train I can catch to get there around 5ish, giving them a little bit of lee-way so I&#8217;m not waiting around too long.</p>

<p>I shouldn&#8217;t have expected it to be done when I got there.</p>

<p>It was almost deja vu, the whole crew sitting outside on yet another smoko. <strong>I was there at 5pm. </strong>I walk inside expecting to see a receptionist, only to buzz and have her come in from the door where next to they were having their smoko. &#8220;Oh, you&#8217;re here for the VL? Won&#8217;t be too much longer.</p>

<p>So I wait.</p>

<p>And wait.</p>

<p>And wait.</p>

<p>At <strong>6pm </strong>I am starting to get moderately pissed off. It shouldn&#8217;t take <strong>two days </strong>to fit a new door, which they didn&#8217;t do.</p>

<p>At <strong>6:15pm</strong> I am getting more and more pissed off. Tapping my feet, rubbing my face&#8230; ugh.</p>

<p>At <strong>6:30pm</strong> I make it my mission to walk out at <strong>6:45</strong> without telling them, leaving to get dinner and hopefully returning when it&#8217;s done.</p>

<p>At <strong>6:40pm </strong>My car is finally ready. I get in it and try out things. The first thing I tried was the door handle, which was still the original door handle. They had only replaced the outer shell of the door, not the entire door like I thought they would. The handle is probably still going to be dicky, and if it fucks up I&#8217;m going to raise Hell.</p>

<p>Then I wound down the window, which worked. Then I got in and tried adjusting the mirror only to find the control on the inside was still unresponsive as before hand. This was another thing that wasn&#8217;t fixed.</p>

<p>This is sub-par service from an &#8220;approved repairer&#8221;.<strong> No customer should have to wait an hour and forty minutes without any kind of compensation, offer of food/drink or mention of how long it's going to take.</strong> I would ask the RAA to take away their status as an approved repairer, but I&#8217;m thinking it&#8217;s more of the insurance company&#8217;s fault for not doing a proper inspection of the car, like they should have. I&#8217;m pretty sure I mentioned to them about the handle and the mirror, but nothing was done.</p>

<p>Now I&#8217;m going to have to wait until Monday before I hear anything more about my mirror and handle. I don&#8217;t want to pay anything, I shouldn&#8217;t have to pay anything. They should&#8217;ve done the job properly the first time.</p>

<p>Never trust crash repairers. Always get THEM to call YOU when it&#8217;s done, don&#8217;t ask them when it&#8217;ll be ready because whatever they say will be <strong>false</strong>.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ll be back later, building my mini-nuke &#8220;in case of emergency&#8221;</p>}]]></content>

   <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Not so long ago I wrote a post about <a href='http://frozenplague.net/2008/03/14/telemarketers/'>receiving a call from a telemarketer</a> after bragging about never being called by one the day before.</p>

<p>Today I received my second call from a telemarketer, this time from a different mob. This time my number had been &#8220;randomly selected&#8221; and I was entitled to a whole heap of gift cards from various retailers. After listening to his spiel (whilst typing &#8220;LOL TELEMARKETER&#8221; in chat) I asked him where he got the number from. He gave back a vague reply of &#8220;our database&#8221;, and I informed him that my number is a top-secret government number and any company calling it can face a fine of up to $250,000. I asked if he knew about that law and he replied he didn&#8217;t. I kindly asked him not to call the number again else his company will be fined, and to take the number off his database.</p>

<p>&#8220;Right away, sir! God bless. Bye!&#8221; he said hurriedly.</p>}]]></content>

   <title>Christianity vs Lanism</title>
   <link href="http://ryanbigg.com/2008/03/christianity-vs-lanism"/>

   <id>http://ryanbigg.com/2008/03/christianity-vs-lanism</id>
   <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>From Friday morning up until midnight this morning (or last night, depending on how you view it), I was attending <a href='http://www.inlan.net.au'>InLAN</a>&#8217;s Great Friday LAN event. Before the event started however, I had Devastator and Freddy who wanted to attend the church service held in the same building beforehand. So that&#8217;s what we did.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m not a fan of church. Never was, never will be. I used to go to an Anglican school (Trinity College) and I found the assemblies a waste of time, and that just re-enforced my view of church being a waste of time. Time spent doing other things, like singing, instead of improving my knowledge. Notices could&#8217;ve been distributed by email as every student on the campus had access to email. Trinity Sunday was a 3 hour &#8220;celebration&#8221; of the school, basically a large yawn-fest. Worst of all, it was held on a Sunday.</p>

<p>But! I went to this service, and I found it not as drawn out as my other past church experiences, apart from Ray Frost who had only one tone of voice to speak in. The songs were variable, but could&#8217;ve done with more variety other than Jesus this, Jesus that, but I guess that&#8217;s what church is about. I even got a &#8220;Care Card&#8221;, which lists such options like &#8220;I want to commit my life to Christ&#8221;, &#8220;I would like a name badge&#8221; and&#8221;I would like someone from the prayer ministry to come and pray with me&#8221;, all of which I rolled my eyes at. Didn&#8217;t they think of all the trees that died just so they could print out these cards?! God.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t believe in the whole God thing either. My opinion on the subject is that somebody wrote a semi-fictional account of events back in those days, and the book, or collection of books, has spread to so many people that they actually believe in what was written. Songs have been written about characters from this book, mostly about Jesus and God. I view the bible as an excellent work of fiction, much like Lord of the Rings. Now imagine if somebody wrote a book on a gamer. The gamer who was born into poverty (north or south suburbs of Adelaide), and rose throughout the ranks to become one of the greatest gamers. Along the way, he could not only own the noobs, but also teach them how to play better. The fiction? Simply by his touch could he improve the skill of any other player for any game by a significant amount. The Church of Gaming has a nice ring to it.</p>

<p>I guess we already have a very similar format to churches. We all meet in one place, we share a common interest, we give thanks to the gaming gods (Devastator, Insane Gazebo, me Fatal1ty, etc.). We sometimes exclaim in joy or frustration, &#8220;hax!&#8221;, much like the Christian term &#8220;Jesus Christ!&#8221;. But one of the key differences I see is that we don&#8217;t have a gaming book to read from, like the Bible of Gaming. Instead, we rely on knowledge and products of and recommended by other people. It&#8217;s a great way to share information and socialise at the same time.</p>

<p>InLAN was great fun (apart from getting a talking-to by TheScream about selling Jolt, which I broke even over), and I had a lot of fun there, I even got plenty of sleep.</p>

<p>The first comp I participated in was Quake 3 Corkscrew in which Insane Gazebo utterly dominated. Some of the kills he was getting were extremely awesome, and by the end of the 30 minute round he was &#62;100 points above second place, me. I asked him after what his accuracy was, and it showed to be 61%. He&#8217;s a bloody legend.</p>

<p>I participated in the TF2 6v6 competition with Devastator, Cadiniller, Spike, Insane Gazebo (Zebo), TheScream and we easily won on 2Fort. My favourite part of this competition was in the second game, two minutes after Zebo and Devastator had taken out their only sentry we were on 1 point and we needed 3 for an assured win. We were planning on attacking and I switched to scout. I got into their base with no resistance whatsoever, managed to get down to the intel room and back up the straight stairs without seeing a thing, and then jumped into their courtyard to be confronted by a Heavy and Soldier. Heavy started spinning his minigun and the soldier shot a few rockets at me (all missed) and I walked out of there with most of my health still. The speed of which Cadiniller and TheScream were able to get their sentries up was amazing, and their placement of them. Nobody got close. Zebo was an amazing soldier and Devastator should earn a purple heard for his medic work. Let&#8217;s not forget Spike who ensured anyone walking in through the front door would have 8 sticky mines to contend with. For that comp we all won a 2GB flash drive, which Devastator and I gave away (I have no need for one) to a daughter and father combo who attend the LAN regularly but never win anything.</p>

<p>I also participated in Call of Duty 4 FFA, which I won. I didn&#8217;t have a strategy and Woodstar and I convinced aX to run the comp on Shipment because we didn&#8217;t have that many players. I switched to my 5th custom class which just so happened to have Martydom (drops a grenade when you die), which got me most of my kills. Favourite part of this was Sgt. Moo running at me, did almost a complete circle and then stabbed me for the kill. He was so quick. Also Woodstar&#8217;s and Morita&#8217;s identical abilities of just so happen to be standing on top of my dropped grenade when it exploded. Thanks guys. For this I won a Logitech G7 which roxxors my soxxors.</p>

<p>Thanks to the InLAN guys for holding an awesome lan party and to all the other people who attended for making it fun.</p>}]]></content>

   <title>It's Been One Week</title>

   <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Since I switched to Ubuntu for my development work on my main PC, and I&#8217;m loving it. Here&#8217;s a few things that make Ubuntu cooler than Windows XP: <ul>
	<li>Tabbed Consoles. I can press Alt+` and I get a new tab, instantly, in my console window open to the current directory I was working in. If I need a new console I can setup a new shorcut in System -&gt; Preferences -&gt; Keyboard Shortcuts to create one when I press Ctrl+` (you people who type on the home row might wonder why I did this... I don't type on the homerow. Fingers go wherever they please)</li>
	<li>The inability to click that naughty TF2 icon. Earns me more money every time I don't think about playing it. To get to TF2 I have to reboot, maintain attention through the reboot to remember to press Escape and then select Windows XP, wait for XP to boot, and then wait for the game to boot. I get... emotional when I play TF2, so it's probably also better for my blood pressure.</li>
	<li>irssi. My god! For a console chat client this <strong>kicks ass.</strong> I've set it up to automatically connect to three servers, (EnterTheGame, EyeRC and Freenode), authenticate me and join all the channels as soon as I start it up. No registration window, no welcome screen, it just does it.</li>
	<li> I can install anything and there's multiple ways to do it. Firstly, I can do apt-get install &lt;anything&gt; and it'll install it. It even takes multiple parameters, so I can install as many things as I want, at the same time. It doesn't even care about what programs I have running, it  just does it. The other way to go about it is to go into System -&gt; Administration -&gt; Synaptic Package Manager, and select your packages in there. It even comes with a search feature.</li>
	<li> I don't have to compile everything I want to install, unlike <a href='http://gentoo.org'>certain other linux operating system. </a>Everything installs as fast as I can download it, plus a few seconds on top of that, at the most.</li>
	<li>Automatic updates. It gives you a non-obtrusive indication that there's updates available, whenever you need them. Oh, and it's not just for the operating system, unlike <strong>other operating systems.</strong> It'll update all your programs that you installed using apt-get or the Synaptic Package Manager.</li>
	<li>Want office? That's automatically installed. Want tetris? That's installed. Want Firefox? That's installed. Want a photo manipulation program? That's installed. Want something to draw pretty pictures in (Gimp)? That's installed. I can go on.</li>
	<li>The places menu. Why, oh why, does Windows not have this? This is awesome.</li>
	<li>Compiz (which currently doesn't work for me, but used to). Makes everything pretty. You can spend minutes, if not hours, toying around with Ctrl+Alt+Left Arrow or Right Arrow and all the funky settings for making your windows fade in/out, exploding or whatever. Again, kicks ass.</li>
	<li>Shit actually installs. I can install stuff because I've installed the <em>build-essential </em>package (quite sizable, but worth it), by using the compiler. Does Windows come with a compiler? No? Well that's too bad. Switch to a decent operating system.</li>
	<li>Memory usage. Currently I have, Pidgin, two consoles, Netbeans, gFTP, Firefox, XMMS, an IM window from Pidgin and System Monitor. I am only using 456mb. Doing the same thing in Windows would probably push it up to something more like 700-800mb.</li>
</ul> The only thing I can&#8217;t do (yet, and because I haven&#8217;t set anything up to do it) is play games. But this is my development operating system, if I want to play games I&#8217;ll use Windows. I could go on, but there is so many awesome things about Ubuntu. Try it for yourself, do yourself a favour. <a href='http://ubuntu.org'>http://ubuntu.org</a>. You&#8217;ll thank me later.</p>}]]></content>

   <title>Administration Namespacing</title>
   <link href="http://ryanbigg.com/2008/03/administration-namespacing"/>
   <updated>2008-03-16T00:00:00+10:00</updated>
   <id>http://ryanbigg.com/2008/03/administration-namespacing</id>
   <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A while after completing work at SeaLink, Tom asked me about my forum hobby project and why it wasn&#8217;t working. This led to me working on it for a few days and getting it all up to scratch again, and this involved moving it over to Rails 2.0 (that&#8217;s how long I hadn&#8217;t worked on it for), and using the awesomeness that is namespacing.</p>

<p>Namespacing is where you have some controllers in a separate area of your site. In my example, I have an admin folder in <span class='term'>app/controllers</span> which contains all the controllers for the administration section of my site, and all the relevant actions. Just inside the <span class='term'>app/controllers</span> directory, I have the other controllers which do all the basic stuff such as showing forums, basically anything a standard user can do.</p>

<p>It seems to be a fairly common question asked in places, so I figured if I sat down and wrote this, I would have something to send to people, much like my <a href='http://frozenplague.net/2008/01/06/restful-routing-an-overview/'>Restful Routes tutorial</a>, which ideally should&#8217;ve covered namespacing too.</p>

<p>First of all we&#8217;re going to create our namespace. To do that, we open up <span class='term'>config/routes.rb</span> and specify our namespace: <pre lang='rails'>map.namespace(:admin) do |admin|
admin.resources :forums, :topics, :posts
end</pre> Now what this does is defines some routes for us. If you&#8217;ve seen <span class='term'>map.resources</span> you&#8217;ll know that this defines routes for us, for example doing map.resources :forums will define methods such as <span class='term'>forums_path</span> which is the same as <span class='term'>{ :controller => "forums", :action => "index" }</span> and <span class='term'>forum_path(@forum) </span>which is the same as <span class='term'>{ :controller => "forums", :action => "show", :id => @forum.id }</span>. These methods really are lifesavers and save you a hell of a lot of typing. The routes defined by this namespace method however are prefixed with whatever argument you pass it, in this case we&#8217;ve passed it <span class='term'>:admin</span> so it&#8217;s going to give us routes like <span class='term'>admin_forums_path</span>, which is the same as <span class='term'>{ :controller = > "admin/forums", :action => "index" }, </span>and as you can see again saves us a lot of typing.</p>

<p>Now that we have our namespace, we can create our subfolders. These subfolders are placed in <span class='term'>app/controllers </span>and <span class='term'>app/views </span>and are given the same name as the namespace, admin. So go ahead and do that now. In <span class='term'>app/controllers/admin </span>is where we place our controllers. As an example, here&#8217;s what my forums controller&#8217;s edit and update actions look like: <pre class='markdown-html-error' style='border: solid 3px red; background-color: pink'>REXML could not parse this XML/HTML: 
&lt;pre lang=&quot;rails&quot;&gt;class Admin::ForumsController </pre></p>

<p>def update @forum = Forum.find(params<span>:id</span>) if @forum.update_attributes(params<span>:forum</span>) flash<span>:notice</span> = &#8220;Forum has been updated.&#8221; redirect else flash<span>:notice</span> = &#8220;Forum has not been updated.&#8221; render :action =&gt; &#8220;edit&#8221; end end end&lt;/pre&gt; What I really want to show you in here is only the first line the class is defined as Admin::ForumsController, which shows that we&#8217;re namespacing it. We don&#8217;t have to define the Admin prefix anywhere. What we do have to define however is our non-existant Admin::ApplicationController. In my code, I&#8217;ve defined my own Admin::ApplicationController as a means of calling methods that should be called before all admin actions, such as my <span class='term'>non_admin_redirect</span> method, which is defined in <span class='term'>lib/authenticated_system.rb</span> and goes something like this: <pre lang='rails'>  def non_admin_redirect
    if !is_admin?
      flash[:notice] = "You need to be an admin to do that."
      redirect_back_or_default(:controller => "/accounts", :action => "login")
    end
  end</pre> To define your <span class='term'>Admin::ApplicationController</span>, make a file in <span class='term'>app/controllers/admin</span> called <span class='term'>application_controller.rb</span>. Even though the main application controller is defined as <span class='term'>application.rb</span> in <span class='term'>app/controllers</span>, that file is automatically loaded by Rails. If we named our application_controller to just application.rb, it would not be automatically loaded because Rails only looks for application.rb and files ending in <em>controller.rb in the app/controllers directory, so we name ours application</em>controller.rb so it plays nice with Rails.</p>

<p>In here we define our class, layout and helper: <pre class='markdown-html-error' style='border: solid 3px red; background-color: pink'>REXML could not parse this XML/HTML: 
&lt;pre lang=&quot;rails&quot;&gt;class Admin::ApplicationController </pre></p>

<p>The before_filter is triggered before every action in the admin controller to make sure it&#8217;s an admin doing the action rather than a standard user.</p>

<p>And that&#8217;s all there is to it, really. It&#8217;s all pretty simple. Now all you&#8217;ve gotta do is generate your views. Remember to place them in app/views/admin/the_controller&#8217;s_name, otherwise you&#8217;ll run into problems.</p>

<p>It seems I forgot to mention how it&#8217;s supposed to work when you&#8217;re calling the method to go to the namespaced path, well that&#8217;s simple. If you have a forum you would like to edit, the correct method is <span class='term'>edit_admin_forum_path(forum_object)</span>, because you want to edit, in the namespace of admin, a certain forum. For paths not requiring a prefix, such as the show and index actions, they are <span class='term'>admin_forum_path(forum_object)</span> and admin_forums_path respectively.</p>

<p>For an action such as an update action, it would be <span class='term'>admin_forum_path(forum_object)</span> with a <span class='term'>:method => :put</span> option specified in whatever you&#8217;re using. Usually you won&#8217;t have to do this, because the form_for helper would do it for you, but in some cases you might have to.</p>}]]></content>

   <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I was joking on Eyerc yesterday that we haven&#8217;t yet had a power outage, and at dad&#8217;s house last night just after he finished cooking dinner, the power went out. gg etsa.</p>

<p>I went over Dad&#8217;s for dinner last night and he was telling me he was sick of getting calls from telemarketers. We joked about what we should do when these idiots call up. I bragged about never receiving a single call from a telemarketer since I moved into mum&#8217;s house.</p>

<p>That changed this morning.</p>

<p>Apparently I&#8217;d won a free trip to Florida! So I pressed &#8220;9&#8221; for more information and waited. This is the worst part, where they call you and then put you on hold. It&#8217;s a pathetic tactic. I waited some more, and eventually some guy with either a very good or a very bad (depending which way you look at it) american accent came on the line. He greeted me, and I greeted him back with the line: &#8220;Never call this number again. Take it off your list. Call it again and I will hunt you down.&#8221; I don&#8217;t exactly view these people as human, so I hung up.</p>

<p>So what&#8217;s your stories for telemarketers? I want comments!</p>}]]></content>

   <title>Now With 100% More Evil</title>
   <link href="http://ryanbigg.com/2008/03/now-with-100-more-evil"/>
   <updated>2008-03-12T00:00:00+10:00</updated>
   <id>http://ryanbigg.com/2008/03/now-with-100-more-evil</id>
   <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>So I installed Ubuntu on my main computer to give me some distraction from that lovely TF2 icon sitting in RocketDock, and so I could use Git (that&#8217;s another story altogether). Everything worked beautifully! I installed it two nights ago at 12am, shortly before going to bed and got up halfway through the night to finish the installation process and set a few downloads (build-essential mozilla-thunderbird ruby1.8-dev ruby1.8 irb rake rubygems rails mongrel apache2 mysql-server5.0) going, and then went back to bed. I didn&#8217;t mind the fact that both my screens were clones of the same window at this time of the morning.</p>

<p>I got up and tried to do some coding but I <strong>needed </strong>my dual-screens. So I went on the nvidia site and downloaded the drivers and then I had to kill X to install them. So that&#8217;s what happened. Installed the drivers fine, loaded it all up again and it was perfect! nvidia-settings was my next installed item, which gave way to <strong>ultimate dual-screening glory </strong>and my coding for the rest of the day. It was sunshine, rainbows, lollipops, unicorns, fluffy bunnies <strong>and more</strong>. It was beautiful. I was at peace.</p>

<p>Until the kernel updates came through. <blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote><em>"Please restart your computer"</em></blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote> And so I did. That&#8217;s where the fun started. Upon rebooting my computer all hell broke loose. The rainbows turned to rainclouds, the lollipops to tofu, the unicorns to rottweilers and the fluffy bunnies to those burning head things from Doom. Ubuntu had launched itself into low graphics mode.</p>

<p>But I was young and naive! I thought &#8220;surely I can just click this configure button, set it to the proper settings and it will work perfectly&#8221;. I was stupid. Upon clicking the OK button, it launched me into a black screen of doom for all eternity. Until I pressed the reset button. I did this a few more times until I figured out the Ubuntu low-graphics dialog <strong>is a piece of crap, and should never be trusted.</strong></p>

<p>Launching into the recovery console got me further (as I was actually able to type) so I ran <em>dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg</em> and the driver&#8217;s install again and X started perfectly. Everything was reverted back to the sunshine-land state of rainbows, lollipops, unicorns and fluffy bunnies. Running <em>nvidia-settings </em>again worked, and I even restarted X just to make double sure it wouldn&#8217;t happen again.</p>

<p>I launched straight back into my coding with gusto, but got sick of listening to the radio, especially those new songs by Rihanna, Souljah Boy, Akon and so on. I wanted my music. I thought, no problem! I&#8217;ll just install <em>ntfsprogs </em>and mount my Windows partition.</p>

<p>Apparently my windows partition hadn&#8217;t shut down properly (it requires lulling to sleep on a bed of silk sheets with velvet pillows whilst listening to Chopin), so I rebooted and launched into Windows only to shut it down, this time I hoped properly. I went back into Ubuntu and low-graphics mode made it&#8217;s stunning return.</p>

<p>More than likely at this point I made some choice remarks about Ubuntu, none of which should ever be repeated since Ubuntu is my bitch now, and the neighbours on all four sides (behind, left, right and across the street) probably made out what I was saying with minimal effort. Again the whole rebooting into recovery console and re-installing the drivers.</p>

<p>That was yesterday. Today I turned on my computer and I knew that low-graphics mode was going to come up, so I went into the recovery console and did my thing, and it all worked perfectly. <strong>But it was annoying! I did not want to do this every time I booted my computer! Why should I?</strong></p>

<p>I looked for a solution, and even grumbled about it in #rubyonrails on freenode, until a user by the name of dfr came along and suggested a few things. He told me there&#8217;s more than just running the drivers, you can specify options like it not asking you questions at all and automatically accepting the license agreement. So I hacked up a nice file that now lives in /root/fix-stuff, that looks a little like:</p>

<h1 id='binbash'>!/bin/bash</h1>

<p>./NVIDIA-Linux-x86-169.12-pkg1.run &#8211;no-x-check &#8211;no-recursion -N -b &#8211;no-runlevel-check -n -q -a</p>

<p>Which is called from /etc/rc.local (a file that runs on every runlevel) which reinstalls the drivers for me on every boot.</p>

<p>The options are, obvious, obvious (doesn&#8217;t check for conflicting files deeper than the surface), no networking, no backup,obvious, no precompiled interface, don&#8217;t ask any questions and I agree with the user agreement!</p>

<p>On another topic, I&#8217;m sick of the 20 spam posts per day so I finally got around to getting a Wordpress API key. If you look at the bottom of the template you should see a counter to exactly how much spam this has killed. So, all you spam-whores: Go away.</p>

<p>So there you go, that&#8217;s why I&#8217;m now 100% more evil, and 100% happier.</p>}]]></content>

   <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Wow, this is the <strong>9th day in a row </strong>above 35 degrees celcius here, apparently a record for the state. No relief until Monday <strong>next week at least</strong>. Keep those airconditioners going people! Maybe if we turn them up high enough we might just reverse global warming! <em>rolleyes</em></p>

<p>Last week I got a phone call from my Nanna&#8217;s husband, Doug, a 70-something year-old who&#8217;s semi-competent with computers. He wanted me to come over and take a look at his computer because his Internet Explorer kept hanging when he went to his church&#8217;s website (Church of Latterday Saints). So I went over there.</p>

<p>His place is about 20 minutes away. This day just so happened to be one of the days where my car&#8217;s air-conditioning was doing a fantastic job by <strong>not turning on at all</strong>. I wind my window down as far as it goes. (about 1/3rd, thanks to Mr. Daniel Thorpe) I arrive there and peel myself out of my seat, and step out onto the footpath. It was warm out here, but not as bad as what the car was. I knock on the door and Nanna answers it and lets me in. It&#8217;s like the friggin&#8217; Arctic. I couldn&#8217;t spot the polar bears or penguins, and I might&#8217;ve seen an igloo. (heat exhaustion, anyone?) There&#8217;s Doug sitting in his computer chair, and he welcomes me in. He&#8217;s not wearing a shirt. Not what you want to see. I helped him through his problem and almost instantly suggested he try Mozilla Firefox and so he did. Importing his bookmarks was a cinch, and that&#8217;s all he wanted. They bought me lunch and afterwards we talked for a bit, and I left.</p>

<p>That image will still haunt me. Doug, in shorts, no shirt. <em>shudder</em></p>}]]></content>

   <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>After finishing my contract with SeaLink on the 25th January, I took a two week break from doing anything Ruby on Rails and then jumped straight back into it. I&#8217;ve recently tied up my loose end with JustComputing and they&#8217;re happy enough that I&#8217;m done with their system that they gave me 4 x 500GB harddrives. I&#8217;m now doing some contract work for SA Window Cleaning and I&#8217;m hoping that I&#8217;ll be done in about a month. After that, Dad wants me to do a job for him for his work (photocopier company) and I&#8217;ve still got offers from NetFox and CarbonPlanet, as well as Lama Chandrasena.</p>

<p>I appreciate everyone&#8217;s interest in wanting me to do work for them, but unfortunately I&#8217;m tied down for the next couple of months at least, which is a good thing. I&#8217;d love to work for NetFox, as that was the first thing to gain my interest when I went to the first Ruby Users group back in May last year, but I wanted a break from anything networking (after doing a couple of years of it at TAFE), so I went for SeaLink and that was a blast!</p>

<p>NetFox still has me interested and I&#8217;ll probably go for that after these couple of other jobs are done.</p>

<p>Thanks again to the people who have asked me if I want to work for them. I hope to talk with you all at the Ruby Users Group meeting next Tuesday!</p>}]]></content>

   <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today I went on a bike ride, I had originally planned to ride from <a href='http://maps.google.com/maps?f=d&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;saddr=Adelaide&amp;daddr=-34.826205,138.694496+to:Elizabeth+East&amp;mra=dpe&amp;mrcr=0&amp;mrsp=1&amp;sz=12&amp;via=1&amp;sll=-34.8253,138.637695&amp;sspn=0.205174,0.32135&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;ll=-34.830714,138.661194&amp;spn=0.410321,0.6427&amp;z=11'>Adelaide to Elizabeth</a> but Tom decided he wasn&#8217;t going to go so I&#8217;d thought I&#8217;d just make it up as I went along. I changed my idea to<a href='http://maps.google.com/maps?f=d&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=21828087726211148,-34.833179,138.693705&amp;saddr=Adelaide&amp;daddr=-34.832792,138.694539&amp;mra=dme&amp;mrcr=0&amp;mrsp=1&amp;sz=15&amp;sll=-34.834131,138.699603&amp;sspn=0.025644,0.040169&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;ll=-34.8772,138.672867&amp;spn=0.205045,0.32135&amp;z=12'> Adelaide to the other end of the Obahn (Tea Tree Gully) </a>and back, but took a few detours along the way and actually did something <a href='http://maps.google.com/maps?f=d&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=7331289563892780050,-34.884350,138.637790%3B8830481223806189783,-34.871944,138.636153&amp;saddr=Adelaide&amp;daddr=Athelstone+to:Og+Rd+%40-34.884350,+138.637790+to:NE+Rd+%40-34.871944,+138.636153+to:Adelaide&amp;mra=pi&amp;mrcr=2&amp;via=2&amp;sll=-34.886494,138.632355&amp;sspn=0.051255,0.080338&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;ll=-34.899448,138.647118&amp;spn=0.102495,0.160675&amp;z=13'>more like this.</a> I could not show the exact path as google maps does not yet do the Linear Park trail. Thankfully, Mr. GPS does and it&#8217;s telling me that I did 40.7km today, and I&#8217;m proud of that fact. I got burnt <em>again</em> and that irritates me for not taking my sunscreen with me.</p>

<p>I am in a moderate amount of pain right now and I know tomorrow will be a day of almost complete stiffness, so if you want me to do anything for you that involves pedalling, running, jumping, throwing, catching or generally moving my legs and arms fast or lifting heavy items, it can wait.</p>

<p>The Torrens looked its most disgusting and it&#8217;s now a string of puddles and ponds more than a river. I say we rename the whole thing to &#8220;The Chain of Ponds Formerly Known As The River Torrens&#8221;! And to think! This is what the Murray&#8217;s going to look like if the government doesn&#8217;t pick up their game.</p>

   <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m sure that if you help out people and live in the help channels of the multitude of IRC servers on the interwebs that you&#8217;re sick of telling people to &#8220;JFGI&#8221; or &#8220;Just Fucking Google It&#8221;, and then end up googling it yourself to provide them with a link so they can go away.</p>

<p>So I created the mIRC alias script known only as &#8220;google&#8221;. Type /google &#60;query&#62; to get a url like <a href='http://www.google.com/search?q=rails+2.0+scaffolding'>http://www.google.com/search?q=rails+2.0+scaffold</a>. Chuck the following in your alias file and never have to google anything again!</p>
<code>
jfgi {
/msg $active http://www.google.com/search?q= $+ $replace($1-,$chr(32),+)
}
</code>
<p>I originally had this posted as &#8220;google&#8221; but apparently users of NoNameScript already have a google alias, so I changed it for them.</p>}]]></content>

   <content type="html"><![CDATA[<strong>Please note: This is now <a href='http://github.com/radar/rboard'>hosted at Github</a></strong>
<p>As a result of Tom (0.01%) and mine&#8217;s (99.9%) work on-and-off for a few months, we&#8217;ve managed to <a href='http://code.google.com/p/railsforum/'>get to a first release of Rails Forum</a>. The goal is to &#8220;be inspired by&#8221; and supercede PunBB and I think we&#8217;re almost there.</p>

<p>The PunBB about page states that: <blockquote>Some features that have so far not been implemented are:   private messaging, file attachments in posts, polls, linking to   off-site avatars, advanced text formatting controls, subforums   etc etc. Some of these features might still get implemented, just   not in the near future.</blockquote> We have private messaging, and we use Gravatar for our avatar system and we have subforums. There&#8217;s only three and a half things on that list (polls, real off-site avatars, adavanced text formatting controls and file attachments) that we have still to do. Polls are easy enough and probably my next goal, off-site avatars will be a bit tricky but I think we&#8217;ll manage and advanced text formatting controls are as easy as installing something like TinyMCE. File attachments can be done with attachment_fu.</p>

<p>What I would like to see is the whole site converted over to HAML as I enjoy working in it&#8217;s strictly tabbed environment and it&#8217;s just so much easier to read as you&#8217;re not reading what is basically the same thing twice. Another thing I would like to see is some bloody tests written for it! We were bad and only wrote a few tests. Pagination would be lovely too!</p>

<p>To run this forum system, you&#8217;ll need to download and extract it onto your computer. Then install Ruby and then Rubygems. After that, do <pre>gem install mongrel rails chronic RedCloth tzinfo</pre> To install mongrel and rails. Hopefully that&#8217;s all you&#8217;ll need.</p>}]]></content>

   <title>Coding With Tom</title>
   <link href="http://ryanbigg.com/2008/02/coding-with-tom"/>
   <updated>2008-02-18T00:00:00+10:00</updated>
   <id>http://ryanbigg.com/2008/02/coding-with-tom</id>
   <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Tom asked me Sunday night if I wanted to go over to his house and code with him for the day and I said yes. I joked about being there at 7 in the morning and he said that would be fine.</p>

<p>I woke up at 10:30 and went on IRC and ping&#8217;d him only to get no reply, he was watching Burn Notice. Eventually he did reply, and re-scheduled it for 12pm, so I played TF2 for 2 hours.</p>

<p>I went to his house and immediately he wanted to get lunch, so we got lunch. Then whilst we&#8217;re eating lunch he said he just wanted to finish watching Burn Notice before beginning to code. He did that, he finished watching his show whilst we worked out how to get the local SVN repo going, which is much faster than the Google code repo.</p>

<p>I fixed up all the bugs (stuff not making the code work on 2.0, mainly) whilst he talked on IRC. He thinks he wasn&#8217;t able to fix up the bugs, but I&#8217;m sure if he just focussed and googled the error messages that came up, he would have the necessary mental capabilities to fix them himself.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve completely moved the admin stuff over to a namespace, changed all the .rhtml files to .html.erb files, made a completely new styles controller (the other one just disappeared) and fixed a few display nuances and as far as I know he has only <em>begun</em> to work on his events thing. I think he&#8217;s written a migration and worked on the form.</p>

<p>At the moment, he has his laptop&#8217;s back facing me, and he&#8217;s talking on IRC about becoming an oper on wombat.eyerc.net with Xaphan and also talking with his girlfriend. It makes me wonder why I even came over in the first place.</p>

<p>Back to work, I suppose.</p>}]]></content>

   <title>IT BURNS!</title>

   <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>No, I&#8217;m not mimicing what the heavy says in Team Fortress 2 when a Pyro has freshly set him alight, I&#8217;m doing something that&#8217;s not TF2! Coding PHP!</p>

<p>After living in a fantasy world of Ruby on Rails for around 8 months, and then jumping straight back into PHP at the niggling, horribly maintained <a href='http://pulse.offbeat-zero.net'>Whatpulse Signature Images site</a> and it was like jumping into a vat of Sulphuric Acid, not that I know what that&#8217;s like.</p>

<p>Lets lead off with a few bad things:</p>
<strong>1. Mother-fucking semi-colons </strong>
<p>What. The. Fuck. Why do I have to end my lines with semi-colons? There&#8217;s been about a hundred times (it feels it) TODAY that I&#8217;ve been caught out because I&#8217;ve missed a semi-colon somewhere.</p>
<strong>2. Brackets</strong>
<p>Why does my if statement need to have ( and ) around the argument? Isn&#8217;t the text after the if ALWAYS the argument? Why the hell does it need curly brackets too?</p>
<strong>3. Coding in Notepad++</strong>
<p>Yay for no syntax highlighting and only <strong>bolding</strong> the ending bracket or parenthesis. It&#8217;s REALLY hard to tell the difference between <strong>}</strong> and } in Monaco. Same with Courier New.</p>

<p>Yay for also 8-months-ago Ryan not knowing how <strong>truly bloody awesome </strong>line indentation is and how much it makes code easier to read. Thanks for Adam for making his code more readable than mine. The guy&#8217;s a PHP God. He probably solves advanced calculus equations <strong>simultaneously, for fun.</strong></p>

<p>Enough ranting. Got to go try out this crap known as &#8220;Eclipse PDT&#8221; to see if it&#8217;s better than Notepad++.</p>}]]></content>

   <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s been a while, but two Fridays ago was my last day working for SeaLink, well, for this contract anyway. You never know if I might get a new contract with them further down the road and I would love to come back and work with those amazing people.</p>

<p>I completed their online bookings &#8220;module&#8221; for their site as the last thing I did before I left, and it seemed they really appreciate it. I even got a better card than what Coles gave me, this one was actually bought from a shop instead of written hastily on receipt paper. Written in it was: <pre class='markdown-html-error' style='border: solid 3px red; background-color: pink'>REXML could not parse this XML/HTML: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;Dear Ryan,
Thank you for all your help &amp;amp; friendship and best of luck with the next exciting chapter of your life. Keep in touch &amp;amp; we all look forward to hear from you.
All the best
Ali.&quot;</pre></p>

<p>&#8220;Dear Ryan, It was good working with you at your blistering pace :) Have fun, and I&#8217;ll see you at next Ruby meetup. Anuj.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dear Ryan, It has been a pleasure working with you. Thank you for your hard work &#38; best wishes for the future. Michael&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dear Ryan, It was great to work with you. hope you do great things in future&#8230; Good luck with your next assignment! Have fun!!! Keep in touch. Vish&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dear Ryan Best of Luck. Who will Elise and I argue with no? Keep in touch to let us know what&#8217;s next. Ems (Emma)&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dear Ryan, Wishing you all the very best with your next adventure! It was lovely to work with you. Now put your shoes back on! Elise&#8221;&lt;/blockquote&gt; I look forward to catching up with these guys again in the coming weeks.</p>

<p>P.S. The shoes reference is I used to take my shoes off when it got really hot as I feel I work better without wearing sweaty shoes. I also used to walk 2km to work every day. <blockquote /></p>}]]></content>

   <title>Beware!</title>
   <link href="http://ryanbigg.com/2008/02/beware"/>
   <updated>2008-02-04T00:00:00+10:00</updated>
   <id>http://ryanbigg.com/2008/02/beware</id>
   <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today I visited a place I have only visited around three times. It&#8217;s plain and boring and generally you only ever go there to lose a lot of money very quickly so you can move around faster (legally) than if you never gave that money away. I made a terrible, terrible mistake by going in at lunchtime. The line was half way to the back of the place and by the time I reached the front the line extended out of it, and then more. I filled out a form with my details on it.</p>

<p>I sat down and read a book, a 70-something page book, whilst little children squealed and bashed trolleys against the bench. I watched as a grown man was pleading with the police to &#8220;stop breaking my arms dudes!&#8221; as he was escorted out. I finished the book, extremely bored with what I just read and let&#8217;s just say it wasn&#8217;t a<em> Lord of the Rings</em> or <em>Curse of the Chosen</em>.</p>

<p>I lined up again in the almost-impossibly long line that was moving even more impossibly slower, thankful that it wasn&#8217;t my child that was making all that racquet. If only there were noise laws against children and people talking on mobile phones obnoxiously loud. The line shuffled forward, ever slowly. I reached the front and was told to fill out yet another form with my details on it (maybe they just <em>really</em> need to make sure it was me?) and to walk over to the other counter with a piece of paper.</p>

<p>I waited whilst a man of asian appearance argued with one of the staff about the identity of his wife (she had a different last name on her passport) and thankfully another staffer came over and assisted me. He told me to sit down at a desk, walked around a corner and asked if I could see anything. I said I couldn&#8217;t, and he disappeared for a few more seconds. Something came up on the screen and he asked if I could see anything, and I politely (but nervously) replied that I could.</p>

<p>I touched the screen and followed the instructions, I focussed eagerly, and at times I suspect on the wrong things and pressed the screen when I was told to. After a few minutes of doing this and listening to the asian man still get more frustrated about the identity of his wife, I completed it.</p>

<p>I was congratulated, and asked to fill yet another form about my identity (maybe they just <em>really really</em> needed to make sure it was me) and walked out of there with a smile on my face and two pieces of paper in my hand.</p>

<p>I did my Hazard Perception Test. I passed first go. I beat my brother to it. That&#8217;s all that matters. One step closer to a full license.</p>

<p>If you do it, pay more attention to the indicators.</p>}]]></content>

   <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I went to the Reloaded festival over the weekend just gone, it was awesome save for the lack of toilets (2 between 400 != good) and complete lack of decently quiet, not bright, comfortable sleeping area and the idiot who made the police come in. A bit tough on the mind, as I was still a tad zombified yesterday, but now I&#8217;m back up to normal. Wookie did a wonderful job with the event even though people will always find something to complain about (and did). The main complaint was that the competitions were not ran on time, or ran way overtime (i.e. the CS:S grand final ending hours after the event was supposed to finish)</p>
<a href='http://flickr.com/photos/radarlistener/sets/72157603816659975/'> I didn't take as many photos as last time,</a>
<p>There was some Team Fortress 2 playing as well, which is now my favourite game (having racked up ~24 hours on it, I might also be addicted) which was fun listening to people shouting out as well as sending back a few insults of my own.</p>

<p>It was incredibly fun and I won&#8217;t blog about it too much here because there&#8217;s too much to blog about. If you want to know what other people thought there is <a href='http://valhalla.net.au/forum/viewtopic.php?f=1&amp;t=11218&amp;st=0&amp;sk=t&amp;sd=a'>a thread on the valhalla forums</a> and <a href='http://www.reloadedlan.com/r3/index.php?topic=717.0'>one on the reloaded forums</a>.</p>

<p>In other news, I&#8217;m holding another RadarLAN at my dad&#8217;s house this coming Friday. As far as I know these are the people who are coming:</p>

<ol>
<li>Me</li>

<li>Tom</li>

<li>Devastator</li>

<li>Freddy</li>

<li>minus_infinite</li>

<li>ax</li>

<li>Michael</li>

<li>Michael&#8217;s Friend</li>

   <content type="html"><![CDATA[<a href='http://frozenplague.net/2008/01/10/job-advertisements/'>Last week I posted about a job advertisement I dissected and picked at on the Ruby on Rails mailing-list</a>
<p>I take much joy in writing these and I feel a sense of irony that I should be reading job advertisements (I&#8217;m out of one next week) and yet I&#8217;m picking them apart.</p>

<p>Also on the job front my friend Paul, whom I met back in Ye Olde TAFE days has finally got a real job (he&#8217;s only had one other job I know of, and that was cleaning dishes at Charlies). In light of this momentous occasion, the world has announced it will be ending on Monday 28th January 2008 at 9am Australian Central Standard Time. There will be free headless horsemen and enternal damnation for all. Afterwards, there shall be cake. Delicious, moist cake.</p>

<p>Entirely coincidentally, <a href='http://www.telstra.com.au/cdmaupgrade/index.htm'>Telstra will be shutting down their CDMA network</a> on the same day.</p>}]]></content>

   <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Later on in the day I stopped in at the mallrat-infested Elizabeth City shopping centre to get some cash out. As I walked back to my car, I was followed slowly by someone who looked like they just wanted a parking space. I thought I would just test the waters, so to speak, and enacted a prank.</p>

<p>I walked up to a car in the parking lot and pretended it was mine. I took my keys out of my pocket and approached the driver&#8217;s side of the car, and looked casually around to see if anyone was walking towards that car. Thankfully there wasn&#8217;t anyone. So I fiddled with my keys for a few seconds, just long enough to make the driver think I was actually going to get in this car (I had no shopping with me).</p>

<p>I pretended to stick the key into the door and try to turn it, only to frown at it and lift my keys closer to my face to fiddle with them longer. Surely the driver would&#8217;ve left by now. I looked over and saw he was there and gave him a wave, the kind of wave where you say &#8220;won&#8217;t be long&#8221; with just a wave and went back to my keys.</p>

<p>Fiddled with them for a few seconds longer and looked puzzled. I look inside the car, making an even more puzzled look on my face and walk to the back passenger window. I look inside, check the rear number plate, and then look up with a big &#8220;Oh!&#8221; look on my face, and do a 270 degree scan of the car park. I look surprised &#38; embarrassed and point my arm towards my real car and walk off towards that with my head bowed.</p>}]]></content>

   <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I was infuriated at this method over the weekend when I found out that it didn&#8217;t use the current year, but instead always guessed Feb. to be 28 days regardless of the current year. My patch uses the current year.</p>

<p>+1 it if you think it&#8217;s a good idea.</p>

<p>This patch is now verified! This means that it will be more than likely to be included inside of Rails 2.1, whenever that&#8217;s released! Thanks to DevF and nzkoz from #rails-contrib on freenode for suggesting that I write tests as well as telling me a cool few tricks.</p>

   <title>Testing: There Has To Be A Better Way</title>

   <updated>2008-01-11T00:00:00+10:00</updated>
   <id>http://ryanbigg.com/2008/01/testing-there-has-to-be-a-better-way</id>
   <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I <strong>hate </strong>testing in Ruby on Rails. I hate writing tests, and I especially hate running them. At work, we have 618 examples and it takes 346 seconds to run. That&#8217;s 5 minutes and 46 seconds to run 6000 lines of code, it&#8217;s pathetic!</p>

<p>The reason for this is that we have a central object which a lot of other objects are related to, called booking. Now, without giving too much away I&#8217;ll say that, along with the bookings table, there are 8 other tables that are emptied and loaded with data during a large majority of the tests. All this emptying and refilling is taking time, time that could be better spent <strong>not waiting for the tests to finish!</strong></p>

<p>This is why I propose a system that entirely relies on fixtures for its data supply, so it doesn&#8217;t have to empty &#38; load the tables again and again, but instead reads directly from the fixture files every time. I have no idea how to go about making one, but if anyone reads this and wants to collaborate with me on something like it, by all means please do. I <strong>hate</strong> having to read my emails whilst waiting for the tests to finish, I run out of emails.</p>}]]></content>

   <title>The Weekend From Hell</title>

   <content type="html"><![CDATA[<font size='4'><strong>Saturday</strong></font>
<p>Tom had invited me over to a LAN Party at Ryan and Steph&#8217;s house, and it was to start at 11am and finish at 11pm. I saw a post on Restful Routing on the rubyonrails-talk mailing list so I replied to it with a full-blown semi-tutorial (the previous post on this blog) for creating a forum system using Restful Routing. At around 11:30 my dad came around and took me to get fitted for a suit for my sister&#8217;s upcoming wedding. He&#8217;d asked earlier about poker this Tuesday night (the 8th) and I told him that I couldn&#8217;t go because I was doing a presentation at the Ruby Users Group meeting that night. He had suggested we go to the Red Lion hotel in Elizabeth where they held poker on Thursday nights. He asked me again on the way to get fitted and I re-affirmed that I was going. The fitting was fine ($119 for a suit!) and without incident.</p>

<p>I got home at around 12:30 and finished the restful routing tutorial after mum cooked toasted sandwiches for me and Michael. I didn&#8217;t start to get ready until 2, where around about <a href='http://flickr.com/photos/radarlistener/2169342209/'>my ceiling started doing this</a>A few months ago it did it also, but not this badly. Michael (mum&#8217;s boyfriend) had only just replaced the ball valve in the airconditioner and that started to happen, not that I&#8217;m blaming it on Michael. So after a few minutes of it dripping and mum panicking that the ceiling was going to collapse, I packed to go to the LAN party.</p>

<p>I arrived at the LAN party and was immediately placed on a small fold out table. These people were there: Ryan Steph Damien Damien&#8217;s Girlfriend? Tilly Emily Daniel Thorpe (vagabond) Bob Thorpe Necrotic / The Lanner Formerly Known As Hordey Me Devastator 3 dogs 3 cats Tom</p>

<p>After realising that this table was only just big enough for my case, two screens, keyboard and mouse, I gave Freddy shit because of his monitor and enormous mouse pad situated next to his enormous pile of junk. He tried unsuccessfully to make room for me (I didn&#8217;t want to move) and instead Damian took the spot Freddy created. We played games like World of Padman and Guitar Hero up until around 6:45 when I left (after obliterating Devastator and Daniel Thorpe in those respective games).</p>

<p>I went to my Dad&#8217;s house because it was my friend-of-15-years Shane&#8217;s 21st birthday and he wanted to hold it at my dad&#8217;s house because he has a pool there. I did the usual greeting thing and Dad told me mum wanted to contact me. She told me that my ceiling had collapsed, a great big hole about 2x2 metres in the roof had opened up and the carpet was soaked.</p>

<p>After the phone call I dipped my feet into the pool and eventually got in. It&#8217;s a good feeling to be in a pool after a day as warm as Saturday was. Eventually other people joined in and we had a good time. Some of Shane&#8217;s mates brought balloons that looked like huge boobs and one of them bought him a blow-up doll.</p>

<p>3 or so hours later I realise that the LAN would be over shortly so I headed back to The Other Ryan&#8217;s house and went to collect my stuff. Daniel Thorpe and his &#8220;crew&#8221; were just leaving, with Daniel apparently complaining of a headache (I wonder why&#8230; <em>cough</em> Hordey <em>cough</em>). Devastator asked me for a ride and as we were packing up our stuff Daniel came in and I originally thought he was joking around and just came back to grab something:</p>
<em><font size='5'><a href='http://flickr.com/photos/radarlistener/2176365677/'>"Ryan, I've hit your car."</a>
</font></em>
<p>&#8220;You what?&#8221;, was my immediate response.</p>

<p>After a little bit of explaining and establishing the fact that it wasn&#8217;t a joke, we all went outside and looked. Dan&#8217;s car was parked about a foot away from mine, and mine had a huge dent (pictures coming later) in the side of the driver&#8217;s door. After more discussion and me keeping my temper under control, I told Dan to go and I&#8217;ll get his insurance details later. Trying to open the driver&#8217;s door failed, the handle was jammed. So I go into the passenger&#8217;s door and opened it from the inside and got someone to shut the driver&#8217;s door to see if it would still open and shut, and it did. So I closed the passenger&#8217;s door, right on to my pinky finger of my left hand. My fingertip was jammed into the door and the instant reaction was to use as much force as possible to move my hand away from the door, and in doing so I pulled out a very numb finger. After much swearing and cursing at mostly everything that went on that day. I took a few photos of the car door.</p>

<p>I took Devastator home and on the way he mentioned he was hungry. I shouted him to McDonalds at Munno Para and we tried to go through the drive through. After trying to wind down my window I realised there was about an inch I could wind it down, and then nothing more. I backed out of the drive through and into a car park and we apologised to the security guard outside. They were surprisingly quick inside, and we were back into the car in no time, and I tried to get into the driver&#8217;s side and remembered that it was jammed, so I got into the passenger&#8217;s side, hopping over the gear stick and handbrake to slide into my seat.</p>

<p>We made a stop over at my house to inspect the damage. Mum and Michael did a good job of cleaning up the mess because when I returned much later that night it seemed like all the debris had just vanished. Also according to mum water might&#8217;ve leaked into the walls as well.</p>

<p>I dropped Devastator home and then went to Michael&#8217;s house and watched the end of Gladiator on his new 44 inch 1080p Sony Bravia TV. He mentioned that he was going to give mum his old 22&#8221; TV.</p>
<font size='4'><strong>Sunday</strong></font>
<p>On Sunday morning I was woken up at the ungodly hour of 7:20am by Mum who said we had to be home at 8:00 for the carpet cleaning guy to come along. I didn&#8217;t see why I had to go as well, as I had driven my car over there, but she just wanted a lift home.</p>

<p>8:00 rolls around with no sign of the carpet dude and I happily set up my computer back in my room and begin to upload all the photos I took of the ceiling and check my emails, talk on IRC and read the forums. 8:35 the carpet guy rocks up and spent about an hour doing his thing. We moved the majority of my stuff out of my room and into the kitchen &#38; dining rooms. He put a blower thing in my room to dry the carpet and the underlay. He was fairly nice and I talked with him about <a href='http://reloadedlan.com'>Reloaded</a> and he said his son might be interested in going, so I gave him a ticket to give to his son as he left. Michael came over shortly afterwards.</p>

<p>I couldn&#8217;t use my computer after that and Mum and Michael went out to get a new entertainment unit for the new TV, so I was left home alone. I decided that I should go for a bike ride since it was a nice day and there wasn&#8217;t really that much else I could do. I liked riding down the Torrens, so I thought it would be good idea to do that today. I grabbed my backpack and put my camera in there and got the bike out of the shed and brought it through the house and out the front door, I locked the back and front doors on my way past so I wouldn&#8217;t forget to do it when I eventually left. I put my bike on the lawn and struggled for a few seconds to find an even spot on the lawn to put it, and the front door slammed behind me.</p>

<p>More cursing and swearing ensued. I tried opening the door but it was locked. The back door and laundry doors were locked too, and I almost cut my hand on the gate when I was closing it. I was locked out of my own house with my backpack and my bike and no wallet, keys or phone. I rode down to where my brother works and asked if he was working, he wasn&#8217;t. So I begun the long ride to his house to get the spare key off him. By chance I happened to pass by the Red Lion hotel which dad told me about poker and I noticed that they had two poker banners up. The first said it started at 7 and the other said it started at 7:30. I went into my bag and took out my camera and saw directly underneath my camera were my wallet and phone, but not my keys. I took a few photos of the banners and headed towards Elizabeth train station to catch the train into town. It was almost dead-on 12pm when I got there and decided to stop in at McDonalds to get a drink.</p>

<p>I walked over to the train station and sat down. It wasn&#8217;t long before Your Usual Elizabeth Single Mother And Child (tm) came along with the mother almost constantly scolding the child. Also Your Usual Homeboy Dressed Up In 50 Cent Shit (tm) came along too. Gotta love Elizabeth residents. The train was scheduled to arrive at 12:17, but it arrived at 12:25. How they can make trains run late on Sunday is beyond me. I got on the other carriage than Your Usual Elizabeth Single Mother And Child did so I wouldn&#8217;t have to listen to them argue. I reached into my bag for my iPod and found it in it&#8217;s usual location. I tried turning it on only to find the battery was flat. It was a long train journey, as all train journeys from Elizabeth are.</p>

<p>Arrived in town and rode down to where I work to see if anyone was working (sometimes they come in on the weekends), and found nobody was there. Went over to the IGA and had lunch (cold sausage roll + coke) and begun riding towards West Terrace. On approaching Whitmore Square I noticed my handlebars were beginning to twist, without me applying much effort at all. This problem only deteriorated the further I rode, and I called dad and asked where I could get some allen keys from, he suggested Jaycar. Jaycar was open and only charged $9 for a set of around 30 allen keys. I got out one I saw seemed to fit the best and some how managed to round it off whilst doing up the bolts on my handlebars.</p>

<p>I continued on my quest down to West Terrace and to a street called &#8220;Goodenough Street&#8221; which I spotted whilst Google Mapping a month or so ago and took a photo of the sign. I rode through the side streets and onto South Road and towards the River Torrens when I realised my right pedal felt funny. I thought it might&#8217;ve been because I had it up the wrong way, but when I looked down I saw that it had partially unscrewed itself and was at an angle. I walked from South Road to the train station, pushing my bike (~4km). Along the way I got a nice sunburn on my arms, face and neck.</p>}]]></content>

   <title>Restful Routing: An Overview</title>
   <link href="http://ryanbigg.com/2008/01/restful-routing-an-overview"/>
   <updated>2008-01-06T00:00:00+10:00</updated>
   <id>http://ryanbigg.com/2008/01/restful-routing-an-overview</id>
   <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Here&#8217;s something I posted on rubyonrails talk:</p>

<p>In truth, restful routing is plain and simple. It&#8217;s like those books you wrote when you were a kid in kindergarten that if a book critic were to read them he would jab his eyes out with a pen.</p>

<p>For this example I&#8217;m going to use a personal favourite: a forum system. It&#8217;s small enough to not be overwhelming, yet large enough to explain how restful routing should work (and generally why you should use it).</p>

<p>It all starts with the good &#8216;ol config/routes.rb file. In here is where all the nice little routes live, from map.root all the way down to the map.connect &#8216;:controller/service.wsdl&#8217;, :action =&gt; &#8216;wsdl&#8217; that many people still leave in their routes file, thinking that if they remove it the entire world would collapse upon itself into one small quantum singularity. In here you&#8217;d place something similar to: <pre lang='rails'>
map.resources :forums, :has_many => :topics
map.resources :topics, :has_many => :posts
map.resources :posts</pre> Not running on Rails 2.0? Then this is the code you want: <pre class='markdown-html-error' style='border: solid 3px red; background-color: pink'>REXML could not parse this XML/HTML: 
&lt;pre lang=&quot;rails&quot;&gt;
map.resources :forums do |forum|
  forum.resources :topics, :name_prefix =&gt; &quot;forum_&quot;
end</pre></p>

<p>map.resources :topics do |topic| topic.resources :posts, :name_prefix =&gt; &#8220;topic_&#8221; end</p>

<p>map.resources :posts&lt;/pre&gt; This defines routes like: <pre>/forums/1</pre> - Show a forum <pre>/forums/1/topics</pre> - Index action for a single forum <pre>/forums/1/topics/1</pre> - showing a single topic <pre>/topics/1</pre> - Same thing <pre>/topics/1/posts/</pre> - I would imagine this would do a similar thing to /topics/1 <pre>/topics/1/posts/1/edit</pre> - Allows you to edit a single post <pre>/posts/1/edit</pre> - Same thing</p>

<p>Now to define something like this without the magic of restful routing, one would have to be clinically insane: <pre class='markdown-html-error' style='border: solid 3px red; background-color: pink'>REXML could not parse this XML/HTML: 
&lt;pre lang=&quot;rails&quot;&gt;
map.connect &quot;/forums/:id&quot;, :controller =&gt; &quot;forums&quot;, :action =&gt; &quot;show&quot;
map.connect &quot;/forums/:forum_id/topics/&quot;, :controller =&gt; &quot;topics&quot;, :action =&gt; &quot;index&quot;
map.connect &quot;/forums/:forum_id/topics/:id&quot;, :controller =&gt; &quot;topics&quot;, :action =&gt; &quot;show&quot;
map.connect &quot;/topics/:id&quot;, :controller =&gt; &quot;topics&quot;, :action =&gt; &quot;show&quot; </pre></p>

<p>Seeing a pattern here? Restful routing gives you a whole heap of cool stuff, namely the 7 core methods that I&#8217;ll cover right after the models.</p>

<p>A forum system has the following tables: forums, topics, posts and users, and the models would look something like the following: <pre class='markdown-html-error' style='border: solid 3px red; background-color: pink'>REXML could not parse this XML/HTML: 
&lt;pre lang=&quot;rails&quot;&gt;
class Forum &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
  has_many :topics
  has_many :posts, :through =&gt; :topics
end&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;pre lang=&quot;rails&quot;&gt;
class Topic &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
  has_many :posts
  belongs_to :forum
  belongs_to :user
end
&lt;/pre&gt;</pre></p>
<br /><pre class='markdown-html-error' style='border: solid 3px red; background-color: pink'>REXML could not parse this XML/HTML: 
&lt;pre lang=&quot;rails&quot;&gt;
class Post &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
  belongs_to :topic
  belongs_to :user
end&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;pre lang=&quot;rails&quot;&gt;
class User &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
  has_many :topics
  has_many :posts
  def to_s
    login
  end
end
&lt;/pre&gt;
The fields don&apos;t matter, but throughout the tutorial I make reference to @forum.name or something similar, so we&apos;ll assume forums has at least a name field. We&apos;ll assume post has a text field and users has a login field.

That&apos;ll give you some idea of how the system works: Forum -&gt; Topics -&gt; Posts.

In restful routing there are seven &quot;core&quot; methods (actions) that you&apos;re given for the controllers: index, show, new, create, edit, update, destroy. Each of these have a set request method on them, for example you can&apos;t GET to the create, update and destroy actions and you can&apos;t post to the index, new or edit actions. These actions work with these request methods:

GET: index, show, new, edit
POST: create
PUT: update
DELETE: destroy

&quot;What the?! PUT &amp;amp; DELETE, where did they come from?&quot;, I hear you cry! These are hacked into the calls for the appropriate action using javascript, it passes in one more parameter (_method) which is then handled by the rails code and depending on what method you called you will get the page you were looking for, or a routing error.

The forums controller could look like this:
&lt;pre lang=&quot;rails&quot;&gt;
class ForumsController &lt; ApplicationController
  def index
    @forums = Forum.find(:all)
  end

  def show
    @forum = Forum.find(params[:id])
  end

  def new
    @forum = Forum.new
  end

  def create
    @forum = Forum.new(params[:forum])
    if @forum.save
      flash[:notice] = &quot;You have created a forum!&quot;
      redirect_to forums_path
    else
      render :action =&gt; &quot;new&quot;
    end
  end

  def edit
    @forum = Forum.find(params[:id])
  end

  def update
    @forum = Forum.find(params[:id])
    if @forum.update_attributes(params[:forum])
      flash[:notice] = &quot;You have updated #{@forum.name}&quot;
      redirect_to forum_path
    else
      flash[:error] = &quot;This forum could not be updated.&quot;
      render :action =&gt; &quot;new&quot;
    end
  end

  def destroy
    @forum = Forum.find(params[:id])
    @forum.destroy
    flash[:notice] = &quot;You have deleted #{@forum.name}&quot;
    redirect_to forums_path
  end

end&lt;/pre&gt;
You&apos;ll see here that I&apos;ve twice made a call to redirect_to using the argument of forums_path. Because we&apos;ve defined map.resources :forums in our config/routes.rb file, it knows that we want to go to { :controller =&gt; &quot;forums&quot;, :action =&gt; &quot;index&quot; } and the best part is that we don&apos;t have to keep trying { :controller =&gt; &quot;forums&quot;, :action =&gt; &quot;index&quot; } every time we want to go to that specific action, but instead we type forums_path.

I&apos;ve also made a single call to forum_path, and I haven&apos;t specified an argument for it, so how does Rails know that I want to go to the forum that I just updated?

Rails will see that there&apos;s an argument mission from the forum_path and will go looking for the @forum instance variable you&apos;ve defined in your controller. If you never defined one or defined it as something other than @forum, it will mention something about ambiguous routes and you&apos;ll have to specify the variable.

Now what if you wanted to go to the new or edit action? Simple: new_forum_path and edit_forum_path(@forum) will take you to the corresponding actions. Remember that you don&apos;t need to specify an argument for the edit_forum_path if @forum is defined. Inside these actions you&apos;ll want to go further, you&apos;ll want to create a new forum and update a forum.

For the create action you could specify this for your form:
&lt;strong&gt;Rails 2.0:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;pre lang=&quot;rails&quot;&gt;&lt;% form_for @forum do |f|%&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
Rails 2.0 will see that @forum is a new record and link you the create action.

&lt;strong&gt;Pre Rails  2.0:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;pre lang=&quot;rails&quot;&gt;&lt;% form_for :forum, @forum, :url =&gt; forums_path do |f|%&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
Prior to Rails 2.0 that checking wasn&apos;t in, you&apos;ll have to define your own link.

&quot;B-b-b-ut&quot;, you stammer, &quot;you&apos;ve linked to the forums index, right? Isn&apos;t that what forums_path is?&quot;

Well, yes and no. This has everything to do with the four request methods mentioned previously, because the form&apos;s method attribute is &quot;post&quot;, Rails knows that if you&apos;re posting to forums_path, you mean the create action. And now for the update action!

Here the form_for&apos;s a little different, but only for pre-Rails 2.0:

&lt;strong&gt;Rails 2.0:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;pre lang=&quot;rails&quot;&gt;
&lt;% form_for @forum do |f| %&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
Again the same deal applies: Rails 2.0 knows that @forum is not a new record, so it&apos;ll link you to to the update action because it&apos;s included in a form. This automatically specifies  :html =&gt; { :method =&gt; :put } for you.

&lt;strong&gt;Pre Rails 2.0&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;pre lang=&quot;rails&quot;&gt;
&lt;% form_for :forum, @forum, :url =&gt; forum_path(@forum), :html =&gt; { :method =&gt; &quot;put&quot; } do |f| %&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
It knows to link you to the update action because of the method =&gt; &quot;put&quot; we&apos;ve specified.

Now lets escape from the confines of a single controller and bring the topics controller into the mix. In the forum show action is where you would generally show all the topics for that forum, but for the purposes of this tutorial I will do it in the topics controller instead. This will have something similar defined to the forums controller but personally I would define this for the controller:
&lt;pre lang=&quot;rails&quot;&gt;
class TopicsController &lt; ApplicationController
  before_filter :get_forum

  def index
    @topics = @forum.topics
  end

  #other actions
  private
    def get_forum
      @forum = Forum.find(params[:forum_id]) if params[:forum_id]
    end
end&lt;/pre&gt;
The private call makes any method after it private, that means that if you were to try and access this method (without restful routing), it would play dumb. Personally, I think something like this should be in-built to Rails, if you&apos;re accessing a child object (topics) from a parent (forum) it should automatically define @forum for you.

Because we&apos;ve already defined the :has_many topics on map.resources :forums, the topic routes are already defined for us, so to view all the topics for a forum, before you would have to do define a route like this:
&lt;pre lang=&quot;rails&quot;&gt;
map.connect &quot;/forums/:forum_id/topics/&quot;, :controller =&gt; &quot;topics&quot;, :action =&gt; &quot;index&quot;&lt;/pre&gt;
and then call it like this:
&lt;pre lang=&quot;rails&quot;&gt;
{ :controller =&gt; &quot;topics&quot;, :action =&gt; &quot;index&quot;, :forum_id =&gt; @forum.id }&lt;/pre&gt;
Instead you&apos;ve already defined :has_many =&gt; :topics, so instantly you&apos;ll gain access to forum_topics_path. Again the wonderful Rails will realise that you want all topics for the @forum object and then direct you to &quot;/forums/1/topics/&quot; through forum_topic_path. To edit a single topic, you could do edit_forum_topic_path as of Rails 2.0, or forum_edit_topic_path prior to Rails 2.0. The first reads more like &quot;edit this topic belonging to this forum&quot; where the second reads like &quot;in this forum, edit this topic&quot;. Alternatively you could ditch the whole forum part out of the method call and just do edit_topic_path because we&apos;ve defined map.resources :topics.

Throwing one more controller into the mix now, called posts_controller. This would be very similar to the topics controller but instead of get_forum it would have get_topic, modified correctly.

Now what if you wanted to add a custom action to posts_controller, called quote? This action would bring up a form with the post you were quoting which would then send the information from the form into posts/new to create a new post:

&lt;strong&gt;config/routes.rb&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;pre lang=&quot;rails&quot;&gt;
map.resources :posts, :member =&gt; { :quote =&gt; :get }&lt;/pre&gt;
The extra argument of :member indicates a hash of any further actions and their request methods you would like to be added onto singular posts. You can call these like all the other singular methods: quote_post_path(@post), for example. The request methods can be in string or symbol format, it doesn&apos;t matter.
&lt;pre lang=&quot;rails&quot;&gt;def quote
  @old_post = Post.find(params[:id])
  @post = Post.new
  @post.text = &quot;[quote=&apos;#{@old_post.user}&apos;]#{&lt;wbr&gt;&lt;/wbr&gt;@old_post.text}[/quote]&quot;
  render :action =&gt; &quot;new&quot;
end&lt;/pre&gt;
Here I&apos;ve defined the old post only to get the text and the user&apos;s name from it, and then we&apos;re rendering the new view so we have the form. Everything from there on is taken care by Rails.

Now what if you want to define a new action to work with a group of posts? Well you define it like this:
&lt;strong&gt;routes.rb&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;pre lang=&quot;rails&quot;&gt;map.resources :posts, :member =&gt; { :quote =&gt; :get }, :collection =&gt; { :destroy_all =&gt; :delete }&lt;/pre&gt;
Now if you wanted to destroy all posts for a topic, bar the first one, with an action like this (remembering @topic is defined in get_topic):
&lt;strong&gt;posts_controller.rb&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;pre lang=&quot;rails&quot;&gt;def destroy_all
  @posts = @topic.posts  - @topic.posts.first
  @posts.each { |post| post.destroy }
  flash[:notice] = &quot;All posts have been deleted.
end&lt;/pre&gt;
You would link_to it like this:
&lt;pre lang=&quot;rails&quot;&gt;
&lt;%= link_to &quot;Delete all posts&quot;, destroy_all_topic_posts_path(@topic), :method =&gt; &quot;delete&quot;, 
:confirm =&gt; &quot;Are you sure you want to delete all posts from this topic?&quot; %&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
The :method =&gt; &quot;delete&quot; corresponds with the :delete_all =&gt; :delete we 
specified in config/routes.rb.

One last thing is nested &lt;span class=&apos;term&apos;&gt;form_for&lt;/span&gt;s. Say you want to edit a post within a topic. To do this you would use this code:

&lt;pre lang=&apos;rails&apos;&gt;
&lt;% form_for [@topic, @post] do |f| %&gt;
  &lt;%= render :partial =&gt; &quot;form&quot;, :locals =&gt; { :f =&gt; f } %&gt;
  &lt;%= submit_tag &quot;Update&quot; %&gt;
&lt;% end %&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

Here you pass one argument still to &lt;span class=&apos;term&apos;&gt;form_for&lt;/span&gt;, an array. It passes the array and will give you a url like &lt;span class=&apos;term&apos;&gt;/topics/1/posts/1&lt;/span&gt; if you were editing an existing post, or &lt;span class=&apos;term&apos;&gt;/topics/1/posts&lt;/span&gt; if you were creating a new post.</pre>}]]></content>

   <title>Tips to Surviving Commercilisation Day</title>
   <link href="http://ryanbigg.com/2007/12/merry-commercialisation-day"/>
   <updated>2007-12-22T00:00:00+10:00</updated>
   <id>http://ryanbigg.com/2007/12/merry-commercialisation-day</id>
   <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s strange how over a period of around a millenia or two Christmas has turned from a celebration of an extremely influential human to yet another commercialisation day. It&#8217;s just used now as an excuse to empty your wallets and fill stockings. I don&#8217;t even believe in Christmas and personally don&#8217;t see why I have to celebrate it, I don&#8217;t celebrate Rammadan or Hanukkah or any other religious holiday, so why Christmas? I enjoy catching up with family, but it&#8217;s just too crazy and commercialised. Here&#8217;s some tips to surviving: <ul>
	<li>Do the speed limit. It's the black number in the red circle on the white signs. The yellow signs only serve as a warning, and do not change the speed limit. Doing the speed limit ensures that your car is not involved in an unfortunate series of collisions with a sledgehammer, and your tires have no nasty cuts in them.</li>
	<li>Don't put your trolley in the middle of a walkway along with your girlfriend and talk to each other. Move to one side and talk.</li>
	<li>Don't walk slowly. Also in the same vein is stopping suddenly and window shopping.</li>
	<li>Have the right money out before the Checkout Whore is done. This speeds things up so you don't have to dig through your purse looking for that 5c piece from 1989, because the one from 2004 is the year of the birth of your grandson and it's one of a kind.</li>
	<li>Checkout people do not want to hear your life story. Neither do I. Don't mention it. If you want to tell people, write a memoir.</li>
	<li>The parking lot lanes are not an excuse to park your car to let friends/relatives out. There are people behind you that you should take into consideration.</li>
	<li>When a P-Plater with a short temper has parked across from an empty park and looks like he's got his car in Drive, it is not advisable to park directly across from him when there are three other spots directly next to it. Park in any of these three spots and you will not be blasted with an assault of verbal abuse, like a fellow I met today.</li>
</ul> Merry Commercialisation Day. See you next year.</p>}]]></content>

   <title>More Migration Sexiness - remove_columns &#38; add_columns</title>

   <id>http://ryanbigg.com/2007/12/more-migration-sexiness-remove_columns-2</id>
   <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>After seeing <a href='http://errtheblog.com/posts/51-sexy-migrations'>a post on errtheblog</a> about them making migrations sexier, I was inspired on the train ride this morning to write something similar. I had a table and I wanted to drop many columns for it and I ended up writing something like: <pre class='markdown-html-error' style='border: solid 3px red; background-color: pink'>REXML could not parse this XML/HTML: 
&lt;pre lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt; remove_column :table, :column_1</pre></p>

<p>remove_column :table, :column_2</p>

<p>remove_column :table, :column_3</p>

<p>remove_column :table, :column_4&#8230;&lt;/pre&gt; and by now you&#8217;re starting to get the idea. I have to not only type out remove_column four times, but also the table name! What a waste of time!</p>

<p>So I hacked up some code and put it into lib/custom_methods.rb.</p>
<pre lang='ruby'> module ActiveRecord
module ConnectionAdapters
class MysqlAdapter
def remove_columns(table_name, *columns)
columns.each { |column| remove_column table_name, column }
end
def add_columns(table_name, type, *columns)
columns.each { |column| add_column table_name, column, type}
end
end
end
end</pre>
<p>So now instead of the monstrosity above I can now type:</p>
<pre lang='ruby'>remove_columns :table, :column_1, :column_2, :column_3, :column_4</pre>
<p>to remove all the columns.</p>

<p>Also inspired by remove_columns was add_columns (already spied by the observant few). There&#8217;s a little difference in add_columns compared with add_column, the type is now the second argument instead of the third:</p>
<pre lang='ruby'>add_columns :table, :string, :column_1, :column_2, :column_3</pre>}]]></content>

   <title>Printer Troubles</title>
   <link href="http://ryanbigg.com/2007/12/printer-troubles"/>
   <updated>2007-12-16T00:00:00+10:00</updated>
   <id>http://ryanbigg.com/2007/12/printer-troubles</id>
   <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today Michael (mum&#8217;s boyfriend) was trying to install a printer onto Mum&#8217;s computer, connected via a 4m USB cable, but it wasn&#8217;t detecting it when he plugged it into any of the USB ports. So then I tried moving it to my computer and it worked. Then I tried sharing it from my computer, only to be met with something I have never seen before with printer sharing: it asked for a username and password. What. The. Fuck.</p>

<p>Anyway, so I moved it back to Mum&#8217;s computer and it still didn&#8217;t detect it. Michael and I played around with it for about another hour and during that time I was so adamant that it was the cable. I didn&#8217;t know how, I just knew it was the cable. So after Michael suggesting that no way in Hell could it be the cable, I decided I would go out and buy a cable.</p>

<p>I bought a 2m cable from <a href='http://dambracomputers.com.au'>D'Ambra Computers</a>, plugged it in and it automatically detected the printer.</p>

<p>Now here&#8217;s my train of thought on this issue (and it could be totally wrong): because the cable was 4m longer the voltage sent from the USB ports on the computer wasn&#8217;t powerful enough to go all the way to the end of the cable and then come back on Mum&#8217;s computer which is a 400W Acer PSU. Because we&#8217;ve put mum&#8217;s old hard drive in there, there might have not been enough power to go the full length any more. My computer has a 600w Thermaltake PSU in it and the printer worked fine in it. Buying the shorter cable meant that the power was able to get all the way to the printer and therefore Windows detected it. This would also explain why were able to plug in devices with much shorter cables than the old printer cable like both the iPods into different ports and another mouse.</p>

<p>So if a printer isn&#8217;t being detected when it should be, try using a shorter cable. It might just do the trick.</p>}]]></content>

   <updated>2007-12-13T00:00:00+10:00</updated>
   <id>http://ryanbigg.com/2007/12/train-doors</id>
   <content type="html"><![CDATA[<a href='http://flickr.com/photos/8068616@N04/2105479910/'><img src='http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2005/2105479910_1e1598aa82.jpg?v=0' align='right' height='116' alt='Didn&apos;t they fix this?' width='154' /></a>
<p>I was interviewed this morning by Hannah Silverman from the Advertiser in regards to the photo (right) that I sent to them. She asked me a lot of questions like: <ul>
	<li>When did it happen? (7:51AM train from Elizabeth)</li>
	<li>What line did it happen on? (Gawler)</li>
	<li>What was your reaction? ("I've gotta get a photo of that.")</li>
	<li>Was there anybody near the doors? (No)</li>
	<li>What did you think was the problem with the doors being open? (If there was a small child they would've gone to look out of the doors and might've fallen out)</li>
	<li> What was everyone else's reaction? (Nonchalant, treating it like it was a regular occurance now)</li>
	<li>What do you think of the train system? ("I think it's a heap of crap.")</li>
	<li>What's wrong with the train system? (Ticket prices increasing, service degrading)</li>
	<li>Contact Details? (You, as in the reader of this blog, are not getting them)</li>
</ul> I hope after all the questions that an article gets published somewhere about this. It would be awesome.</p>

<p>UPDATE #1: Hannah called just before lunch asking me to confirm that it was yesterday. After I got back from lunch, she called again and asked me to pose for a photograph at the Adelaide Train Station. Honestly, I never expected it to get this far. I thought &#8220;hey, they&#8217;ve been hammering this for a while&#8221; so I sent it to them.</p>

<p>UPDATE #2: So I&#8217;ve just gotten back from getting my photo taken at least 50 times in random positions, walking onto the train, leaning against the train, leaning against the barrier. The photographer said it &#8220;might be on the front page&#8221;. If they&#8217;ve taken a photo of me and it&#8217;s in the paper, everyone gets free papers.</p>

<p>UPDATE #3: The photo I took on Wednesday was on the front page. I read the paper cover-to-cover and my photo&#8217;s not in there. It might be in Saturday&#8217;s paper, giving me a weekend to buy a disguise to deceive the AdelaideMetro thugs. <a href='http://www.news.com.au/adelaidenow/story/0,22606,22921394-5006301,00.html' title='The Story'>The story was also on the AdelaideNow site</a>!</p>

<p>UPDATE #4: &#8220;Uncle Fester&#8221; from Port Adelaide posted this comment on the AdelaideNow site, which gave me a chuckle: <p align='center'>"That looks like the DSTO in the background of the photo. Does Ryan Bigg realise he has committed a federal offense by photographing a secure Commonwealth site?"</p> Another commenter, David of Oaklands Park, posted this: <p align='center'>"Would have thought that the fires on Kangaroo Island justify a front page more than a Mr Bigg!!"</p> Thanks David! The fires have been burning for 8 days. The train doors have been malfunctioning longer. Fire can be put out, and all of the time eventually it does happen! The train doors unfortunately will not fix themselves and it&#8217;s up to AdelaideMetro and &#8220;The Government&#8221; to do something about it.</p>

<p>Another one of my gripes is there is not a single window on any carriage I have traveled on this week that some delinquent has not scratched his tag into. I believe this prompts the &#8220;other delinquents&#8221; to do the same after seeing that other people can get away with it. Replace the windows with something that can&#8217;t be scratched, or replace them more often to deter these bastards from blocking my view with their scrawl.</p>

<p>UPDATE #Infinity - Infinity + 5: Googling for my name (Ryan Bigg) returns the article as the second result in &#8220;the web&#8221; and first for &#8220;pages from Australia&#8221;.</p>

<p>UPDATE #6: <a href='http://frozenplague.net/images/IMG_0004.jpg'>Freakin' Huge (tm) front page scan is here </a></p>}]]></content>

   <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>There was an Adelaide Ruby Users Group meeting held last night at the usual location, the Brecnock Hotel on King William Street. This was the first meeting my friend, Tom, had decided to come to and he caught the train into town from Gawler. He eventually arrived at the other end of town at around 5:30 and phoned me up asking where I was. His voice seemed to echo too much, and the stairway in our building doesn&#8217;t echo like it did. I eventually figured out that he was in the TSR building and managed to get up to Level 2 unhindered. Great security the TSR guys have.</p>

<p>I finished up at work and then Anuj, Vishal, The Other Mongrel and I headed over to the Brecnock. Adam and Ali had other things to do and Michael still had his time off from work due to an operation he had.</p>

<p>We ordered our food at about quarter-past 6. It arrived at around 7ish in typical Brecnock style.</p>

<p>The meeting begun at 6:30 and begun with Luke talking about merb and Datamapper. Whilst very interestin, the talk was very long (at least an hour). I will try to grab a video of his talk once it&#8217;s up on the internet.</p>

<p>Afterwards I did a talk on Railscamp with 20 photos that I or other people (Lachie, Tim Lucas, Ryan Allen and Ross Hill) took at Railscamp. I rattled off a list of what presentations there were at Railscamp and this started a talk on Git. The Git talk went on for a while, and it was already 9:00 by this time so Tom and I decided to leave. Apparently the other guys only continued until about 9:15, and the talk turned to usability.</p>

<p>Tom thought it was really good and he said he&#8217;d definitely be going to the next one.</p>

<p>So why don&#8217;t you come as well?</p>}]]></content>

   <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I promised you guys a summary of Railscamp. Unfortunately I managed to lock myself out of sudo on my laptop AND hastily reinstall ubuntu. I could&#8217;ve sworn I had a backup on here somewhere.</p>

<p>Fortunately I&#8217;m supposed to be doing a very short presentation about what went on at Railscamp so I should have at least SOMETHING by next weekend!</p>

<p>Been very busy as of late. The blog went down and I&#8217;ve been playing around with WordPress as a replacement instead of re-inventing the wheel yet again. I simply do not have the time or energy to do something that massive again. WordPress does everything I want it to.</p>

<p>On last weekend&#8217;s Saturday I shaved off the beard and it was itchy. I don&#8217;t recommend it for anybody to grow a beard for 6 months and shave it all off in one go. It&#8217;s like that feeling when you get your hair cut and it goes down the back of your shirt. Now imagine that on your face 10 fold.</p>

<p>Also on the Tuesday (the 4th) just gone, I turned 20. Went out for dinner the Sunday before with my dad, Monday night had dinner at Mum&#8217;s, Tuesday night was poker, Wednesday night was Cafe Primo, Thursday night was play-around-with-blog night and tonight was get-everything-imported-into-wordpress night.</p>

<p>Tomorrow night I&#8217;m off to InLAN with Narthollis, Devastator and Freddy. This InLAN is free and doesn&#8217;t have prizes, but we&#8217;ll still own all the noobs.</p>}]]></content>

   <title>Poker Night</title>
   <link href="http://ryanbigg.com/2007/11/poker-night"/>
   <updated>2007-11-22T00:00:00+10:00</updated>
   <id>http://ryanbigg.com/2007/11/poker-night</id>
   <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I was invited to the APL Poker Night held at the Southern Hotel in Gawler by my dad and Joe on Tuesday night. Usually on Tuesday nights I have dinner with dad at his house, but he wants to learn how to play Texas Hold &#8216;Em.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s a lot of difference between the poker nights I hold and what seems to be the &#8220;official&#8221; Australian League way of playing it.</p>

<p>To begin with, all four suits are organised in a square shape on the table, with each card within the suits visible. Then the cards are turned face down and shuffled on the table by moving the piles around with the players&#8217; hands. Then each player picks a card in order to determine who gets to be dealer.</p>

<p>The selected dealer then shuffles the deck as much as they wish whilst the blinds are posted. Originally the blinds are 25 (small blind)/50 (big blind) and are posted by the two players to the left of the dealer with the person to the left posting the small blind. The blinds are raised every 15 minutes to 50/100, 75/100, 100/200, 200/400 and 500/1000. There is 30 minutes of play in the first round, and then a 20 minute break (which is way too long, imo), and then back into the game until the final table. Before the third and final round there is another break, but I&#8217;m unsure how long that is.</p>

<p>Then the dealer places a red card next to the person to the left of them and the deck of cards next to that. The person to the left then cuts the deck, puts the top half on top of the red card and moves the bottom half on top of that pile. The dealer then deals to their left in a clockwise fashion, giving themselves the last card. Each player gets two cards.</p>

<p>A round of betting commences. All players must bet if they want to stay in, the minimum bet being the big blind. All players can fold at any point and may not retract their cards. I don&#8217;t know if there&#8217;s a re-raise limit, we never got to that point. It would be good to point out at this point you <em>cannot bluff</em>, it is impossible. You will get called (someone else matches your bet) and you&#8217;ll be in the deep end. Once everyone&#8217;s bets are equal, the chips are put into the middle.</p>

<p>One card is then burnt off and then the flop is put out. Another round of betting happens. Players can choose to check (not place out any money), or bet the minimum or more. If a player has checked and another player on the table has bet, then the player must bet if they want to stay in. It is still impossible to bluff, you will get called. All bets are equalised and then the Turn card is put out.</p>

<p>Another round of betting, and the River card.</p>

<p>Another round of betting and then the remaining players can choose to turn over their cards or fold. The player with the best cards win.</p>

<p>The next round the player to the left of the dealer of the first round now becomes the dealer.</p>

<p>Enough of the rules, here&#8217;s how my night went.</p>

<p>I started on table 3 with Joe to my right and dad started on table 1. Joe was the dealer, so I posted small blind. I did very well for the first round, becoming the chip leader for the table. During the break free nibblies were given out and players got to take a break for 20 minutes. After the break it got a little more serious. By this time, the blinds were raised to 100 and 200 and people seemed a little more cautious on betting. I kept getting Queen/2 as my dealt hand, which was frustrating after fishing for the queen for two hands and losing both of them.</p>

<p>There were a few memorable hands in this second round.</p>

<p>The first was with Aaron, a player sitting across the table from me. I was being cocky and thought I had a good hand with two pair, so I bet large. The conversation went something like this: Dealer: <em>deals out the flop</em> Me: <em>bets 500</em> Aaron: So you want to play then? Me: <em>nod</em> Aaron: Alright, I call. Dealer: <em>deals out the turn</em> Me: More please. <em>puts out another 500</em> Aaron: Still playing? I call. Dealer: <em>deals out the river</em> Me: <em>check</em> Aaron: <em>check</em></p>

<p>Aaron got a three of a kind and won. The bastard.</p>

<p>The hand after that I got dealt a little better so I was still cocky, but my ego had a sizeable dent in it from the previous hand. It ended up being Aaron, me and another player. From what I remember I had three of a kind and Aaron had two pair. I won my chips back, and a little more.</p>

<p>Another hand was with Woggy sitting across the table and to my right. The cards on the table were nothing special, beside a queen which paired with the queen in my hand. I had a Queen/4 and unknown to me Woggy (who apparently went to the Regional championships) had a Queen/2. So we bet large, thinking we each had a better hand. It turned out to be a split pot because the cards on the table were better than we had in our hands.</p>

<p>The hand Joe went out on he went all in with 100 (I think) and had a two pair by the end of the hand and Aaron had a full house.</p>

<p>The final hand I played in I was moved to table 1. I was dealer and missed burning off a card somewhere. I could&#8217;ve missed burning the flop card and if I did then a 6 that came out on the flop would&#8217;ve been the burnt card and there would&#8217;ve been the card immediately after the faux River card that was dealt. There were three or four of us left, with the guy across the table from me having a pair of sixes, but if I had burnt off the six in the flop like I was supposed to (and I&#8217;m sure I did), then he would&#8217;ve had nothing. The real river card that should&#8217;ve been dealt was a queen, and I would&#8217;ve won. I basically dealt myself out. I came 12th overall and I plan on doing better next time, maybe more caffeine would help.</p>}]]></content>

   <title>Layin' The Smackdown!</title>
   <link href="http://ryanbigg.com/2007/11/layin-the-smackdown"/>
   <updated>2007-11-19T00:00:00+10:00</updated>
   <id>http://ryanbigg.com/2007/11/layin-the-smackdown</id>
   <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>There&#8217;s a forum on the internet called Rails Forum which is a support forum for Rails (duh). I&#8217;ve been helping out on the forums for a few months now and some of the things people do surprise me. Sometimes they are things like &#8220;why didn&#8217;t I think of that&#8221;, and other times it&#8217;s like &#8220;why did they do that?&#8221;. <a href='http://railsforum.com/viewtopic.php?pid=45524#p45524'>Here's a thread that was one of the latter</a></p>

<p>A guy wanted to add values into a select tag using javascript. He used this code: <p class='code'> window.parent.document.getElementById('client_name').value = '&lt;%= @client.client_name %&gt;';</p> I replied suggesting this code:</p>

<p>&#60;div class=&#8217;code&#8217;&#62;</p>
<pre class='markdown-html-error' style='border: solid 3px red; background-color: pink'>REXML could not parse this XML/HTML: 
&lt;p class=&quot;code&quot;&gt; $(&apos;element_id&apos;).innerHTML = &quot;Option 1&quot;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
Which I know works because I&apos;ve used it before.

Then he replies saying:

&lt;p class=&quot;blockquote&quot;&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Viniosity said:&lt;/strong&gt;
Ended up using:
&lt;p class=&quot;code&quot;&gt; window.parent.document.getElementById(&apos;client_name&apos;).value = &quot;&amp;lt;%=client.id %&amp;gt;&quot;;&lt;/p&gt;
Dear GOD why? At least ditch the window.parent, please!

And I replied yet again:
&lt;p class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;I don&apos;t see how that would work. If you&apos;re having a drop down list, and you&apos;re setting the value attribute on it, well... there just isn&apos;t a value attribute! Are you sure this is working because I think that it wouldn&apos;t.&lt;/p&gt;
I could be wrong, as last time I checked I was Human.

Then he made a reference to me looking like a terminator in my &lt;a href=&quot;http://railsforum.com/img/avatars/174.png&quot;&gt;current avatar on the forums&lt;/a&gt;

Then another guy jumped into the fray called boemitsu who came up with this little beauty:

&lt;p class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt; &lt;strong&gt;boemitsu said:&lt;/strong&gt;
From my experience, this does not work in IE until version 6...

UNTIL VERSION 6! Oh no! Lucky most people are running version 6 (or better or Firefox).

boemitsu also gave this gem of code too:

&lt;p class=&quot;code&quot;&gt; i=0
@var.each {|a|
page &amp;lt;&amp;lt; &quot;$(&apos;id&apos;).options[#{i}] = new Option(&apos;#{a[0]}&apos;,&apos;#{a[1]}&apos;)&quot;
i = i+1
}

Maybe he confused JavaScript with Java?

I replied a final time:
&lt;p class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Me, whilst laying the smackdown said:&lt;/strong&gt;For a moment there I did that thing people do, you know, put one hand on the side of the face and slowly drag it downwards whilst making a groaning noise.&lt;/p&gt;
Then I re-read what you had written:
&quot;This does not work in IE until version 6&quot;

Thankfully there was this new operating system released back in 2001 (October 25th, for those of you playing along at home) called Windows XP. This operating system came standard with Internet Explorer Version 6.0 (six-point-oh). Unfortunately, the majority of people were still using Windows ME, or worse, Windows 98, so the &quot;standard&quot; back in 2001 was what came with those operating systems which was Internet Explorer Version 5.5 (five-point-five).

Fortunately the wonderful people at Microsoft decided that on 11th July 2006 that Windows ME and Windows 98 were to be no longer supported! Fantastic news for Microsoft, of course, this meant that more people had to &quot;upgrade&quot; to Windows XP, therefore giving Microsoft more money in which they were to put into a burning pit of lava they call &quot;Vista&quot;.

My point is this (and honestly, I&apos;m surprised you&apos;re still reading), Windows ME and Windows 98 were basically deprecated in 2006. This means anyone using those had to upgrade, meaning they are now *most likely* running Internet Explorer 6 or Mozilla or Opera or Safari or some other browser, and not Internet Explorer 5.5. If we were to support all the older versions of all the software ever created we would still be coding in Fortran and COBOL, or worse, Perl.

Thankfully, old technology is eventually deprecated meaning that, as web developers, we can say &quot;that is no longer supported, please upgrade&quot; and get away with it. Anyone still running Windows 98 and Windows ME deserves to be shot anyway.

That is all.

boemitsu, the man who apparently never sleeps, replied within an instant:

&lt;p class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt; &lt;strong&gt;boemitsu said:&lt;/strong&gt;
Well sorry that I have written mistakenly until version 6. It should have been version &amp;lt;= 6But anyway...you&apos;re really a cool guy.

So apparently it doesn&apos;t work in IE 6 (and I&apos;m a really cool guy). I&apos;m not sure on this myself (the not working in IE6), as I use Mozilla Firefox. I&apos;ll investigate this later this week and report back.</pre>}]]></content>

<p>Now if I continued this blog post doing that it would get annoying, not only for me but for people who wasted their time reading all the &#8220;like&#8221;s.</p>

<p>The whole point of this blog post is to rant about how people, especially women (I&#8217;m not being sexist), pepper their sentences with the word &#8220;like&#8221; as a verbal filler, like the loud, fat woman on the train this afternoon.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hey honey, would you like to do that thing we did last week?&#8221; (&#8220;legal&#8221; usage) &#8220;You know, like, what Scott and I did last week?&#8221; (&#8220;illegal&#8221; usage) &#8220;Yeah, like we went out on the town and like drunk lots and then we like went to a hotel and like stayed the night&#8221; (No she didn&#8217;t get a triple word score for this)</p>

<p>Then my personal favourite:</p>

<p>&#8220;You know what I&#8217;m saying?&#8221;</p>

<p>I twitched, or was it more like a spasm? Or maybe a mini-seizure, not sure.</p>

<p>Another twitch.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then like we can like go to the like Casino and like gamble and like stuff.&#8221;</p>

<p>This continued for the whole train journey.</p>

<p>Please, for the love of God. Do not pepper your sentences with &#8220;like&#8221;. It is a waste of breath, and a waste of time for whoever has to listen to your nonsense.</p>}]]></content>

   <title>The Train System</title>

   <id>http://ryanbigg.com/2007/10/the-train-system</id>
   <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I got a comment posted on a a <a href='http://www.news.com.au/adelaidenow/comments/0,22638,22684078-5006301,00.html'>news.com.au/adelaidenow article</a></p>
<pre class='markdown-html-error' style='border: solid 3px red; background-color: pink'>REXML could not parse this XML/HTML: 
&lt;p class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt; &lt;strong&gt;I wrote:&lt;/strong&gt;
I&apos;m suspecting the whole two people praising TransAdelaide in the above responses actually work for TransAdelaide.
I caught the 7:51am train (which is almost TWO HOURS after the initial &quot;fault&quot;), and by Mawson Lakes the train was packed. This usually happens, but today it was crazy. Another carriage wouldn&apos;t go astray. Only a half-hearted &quot;TransAdelaide would like to apologise...&quot;, after we arrived.

It&apos;s getting worse, their apologies mean nothing any more. Not just anyone, but everyone involved with the transportation system should not use their cars to travel to work. Instead, they should use their own system, pay the extravagant ticket prices (we pay more and more for a system that&apos;s getting worse and worse, what the?), and put up with what we have to put up with.

It is beyond a joke and something serious will happen and TransAdelaide will be caught with its pants down. It&apos;s only a matter of time.

I&apos;ve been hearing this line more and more frequently, and it has begun to lose all meaning. When a train runs late:

&lt;p class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt; Attention all passengers,
TransAdelaide would like to apologise for the late running of this train.

Words that are fed into the mouth of whoever happens to be driving the train at the time, just to make the passengers feel better. It&apos;s kind of a like a &quot;boy who cried wolf&quot; story. You think they mean the apology the first couple of times, but after it happens again and again you just lose all faith.

What am I talking about? Well, here&apos;s a list of things:

Late running of trains with little explanation, such as a &quot;signal fault&quot;. I&apos;ve heard news reports that a &lt;a href=&quot;http://gov.au/&quot;&gt;certain government&lt;/a&gt; has recently received a $37billion profit. Now if they actually did something with this money it would be good, like ripping up the old Adelaide track and replacing it with a new shiny one that isn&apos;t at least 5 decades old. Yeah, it may be heritage and have a lot of history associated with it, but old things are dangerous. Nothing serious has happened yet, but it&apos;s only a matter of time until something does. The most serious thing to my recollection is a train derailment just outside of Adelaide Station, where the top speed limit is 10km/h. The 1st November 7:51am train arrived on time, but stopped about 500m outside of Salisbury Station with no explanation, and no apology. Not that the lack of apology matters anymore.

Slow points on the track. For no explanation the train slows down to a crawl on some points of the Gawler track that I travel on. I have heard reports of trains doing similar things on other lines. If the track is faulty, then it needs to be replaced. I cannot stress how important I think this is. If some train driver is not fully alert on the job and they don&apos;t slow down for this point, what happens when it derails? Catastrophe.

Timetables are extremely optimistic. If you ever catch the 7:51am train and arrive at Adelaide station and pass through the gates before 8:31am, walk over to the newsagency at the southern end and buy yourself a lottery ticket. Not once that I&apos;ve caught this train have I walked through the gates at 8:31am, it has been as early as 8:32 and as late as 8:51. As a person who relies on the trains 5/7 days, they should be reliable, not random like a lottery.

There&apos;s an election coming up soon, I wonder if that will persuade them to suddenly replace the trains and the track. If not, something will happen. When it does it will be catastrophic. It&apos;s only a matter of time.</pre>}]]></content>

&lt;LegionX&gt; they need an open debate.. with all candidates.... so all the loony parties can speak ;-)
&lt;Radar&gt; Then would it be called a "mass debate"?
</p></p>

<p>Think about it. It&#8217;ll come to you eventually.</p>}]]></content>

   <title>Karma Rules</title>

   <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I blogged a month or two ago, a fictional story based on this short teenaged italian kid who gets on the train every now and then. Usually he board the train with his friends and talks himself up, bragging about who he beat up this week. This week he boarded the train at Mawson Lakes, and punched the door. He was shouting obscenities at someone. I was on my laptop, so I didn&#8217;t pay much attention to him.</p>

<p>He usually gets off at Ovingham, and this time he did also. This is the same stop the fat lady on the wheelchair waits for the train driver to get out of the cabin and put down the planks so she can wheel all 150kg of her fat ass out the door. So the train was stopped.</p>

<p>All of a sudden there&#8217;s a noise outside of the train doors and all the passengers are looking outside at something. I was sitting with my back to the door so I didn&#8217;t catch the start of it. What I&#8217;m assuming is that this angsty Italian kid picked a fight with someone he shouldn&#8217;t have as he got off the train. Still assuming, the hero of this story got off the train with the kid and they proceeded to fight. Let me pause there.</p>

<p>The hero is a 30, possibly 40 something white male dressed in business attire, black pants, light-pink shirt and tie. The kid is dressed in typical teenager clothes.</p>

<p>And now let&#8217;s resume the story. By everyone else looking at what was going on outside it grabbed my attention also. So I turned to see what was happening and I see this kid try to punch this guy. He missed. The hero then rises one leg, pulls it back to his body and then kicks out all in one swift motion as the kid comes at him again. The kick plants itself directly into the kid&#8217;s stomach. This made many people laugh and cringe. The fight continues, going down the outside of the train and out of my view.</p>

<p>The kid deserved it. He&#8217;s rude, he boards without a ticket, and he&#8217;s obnoxious. I just hope the next time he starts a fight with someone the train&#8217;s still moving when they open the doors and he&#8217;s the first one out.</p>}]]></content>

   <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>When I was attending TAFE me and my friends used to play cards. I haven&#8217;t played cards in ages, and I&#8217;m kind of missing that fact.</p>

<p>So I thought I would host a Poker night for the 27th October. Open invitation. It will no longer be held at my Dad&#8217;s house. It will be held at a friend&#8217;s house who has kindly volunteered his shed for it. You know how to contact me.</p>

<p>EDIT: Yes I did have the third of November listed here as the date, but I had told people that it would be &#8220;not this saturday but the one after&#8221;, so just to make it clear it&#8217;s the 27th of October.</p>}]]></content>

   <title>Why I Don't Respond</title>
   <link href="http://ryanbigg.com/2007/10/why-i-dont-respond"/>

   <id>http://ryanbigg.com/2007/10/why-i-dont-respond</id>
   <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Many people that read this blog have my MSN address. For those of you who do not have my MSN address there is probably a good reason for it.</p>

<p>All times mentioned are Australian Central Time +0930 GMT, but in a week they will be +1030 GMT thanks to Daylight &#8220;Savings&#8221;</p>

<p>I would like to remind all of my readers (all 3 of you) that I actually have a job. This job involves me leaving my computer at near enough 7:40am every morning. Then I drive down to the train station, park my car, walk to the train station, wait for the train, get on the train, ride the train to Adelaide, get off the train and then walk to work (1.7km, the whole distance of Adelaide). I arrive at work at 9:00am. This means there is a whole period of 1 hour and 20 minutes where I am incommunicado. Do not leave me messages between 7:40am and 9:00am expecting a reply. You won&#8217;t get one until 7pm.</p>

<p>I arrive at work at 9:00am and generally then sign back in to messenger. You may leave me a message or attempt to strike up a conversation with me, but I am at work and whilst I&#8217;m here I am paid to work, not to speak to you.</p>

<p>IF my job DID involve speaking to you, that would be wonderful. Getting paid to talk to people about nothing in particular. It&#8217;s not. Don&#8217;t think it is.</p>

<p>I am at work until 5:30pm. This is a time that I almost always leave by. The only times where I may be still within reach are when there are Ruby Users Group meetings on (second Tuesday of every month), or I have taken the day off work because I am sick or for other reasons (there has only been one day in the past 5 months when I&#8217;ve done that, gg cold). If you send me a message after 5:30pm, but before 7:15pm, you will most likely not receive a reply until 9am the next day, if you&#8217;re still online. If you&#8217;re not then you have no hope of a reply unless you say whatever you said before.</p>

<p>If you are messaging me on a Tuesday that is not the second Tuesday of the month, or a Thursday immediately following a Ruby Users Group Tuesday, I am over my Dad&#8217;s house for dinner 99.9999% of the time. This means I am incommunicado from 5:30pm up until most probably 8:15pm. During this time I finish work, walk to the train station, wait for the train, get on the train, ride the train to Elizabeth, get off the train, walk to my car, drive to dad&#8217;s house, eat dinner, talk, drive back to mum&#8217;s house, and then log in to MSN.</p>

<p>If it is a weekday and after 10:00pm and I&#8217;m still online, this means I have left my computer on. It also means that I am sleeping. I will not reply until 7:00am the next morning.</p>

<p>That just about covers it.</p>}]]></content>

   <title>Journalism</title>

   <updated>2007-10-09T00:00:00+10:00</updated>
   <id>http://ryanbigg.com/2007/10/journalism</id>
   <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I love writing. I hate it when people who get paid to write, twist words and wrongly report, like <span>url=http://www.news.com.au/story/0,23599,22561539-2,00.html</span>this story on news.com.au<span>/url</span> this morning.</p>

<p>Firstly lets define &#8220;hack&#8221; and &#8220;hacker&#8221; (all from Wikipedia)</p>

<p><span>code=&#8221;Hack&#8221;</span> Hack has several meanings in the technology and computer science fields: a clever or quick fix to a computer program problem; a clumsy or inelegant solution to a problem; or a modification of a program or device to give the user access to features that were otherwise unavailable to them. <span>/code</span></p>

<p>Fair enough.</p>

<p><span>code=&#8221;Hacker&#8221;</span> Hacker, as it relates to computers, has several common meanings, the unifying characteristic of which is only that it refers to a person who is an avid computer enthusiast. It is most commonly used as a pejorative by the mass media to refer to a person who engages in illegal computer cracking, but it can also refer to people engaged in ethical hacking, to the members of the open source and free software community or to home computer hobbyists. <span>/code</span></p>

<p>And this is where it gets to the point. The media&#8217;s view of a hacker is:</p>

<p><span>code=&#8221;Media&#8217;s View of a Hacker&#8221;</span> It is most commonly used as a pejorative by the mass media to refer to a person who engages in illegal computer cracking. <span>/code</span></p>

<p>Journalists do not know how to report. The worst part? They get paid to fail at reporting. Let me explain the story.</p>

<p>The story&#8217;s headline reads &#8220;Hackers raid Liberal official site!&#8221;. Strike one. &#8220;Hackers&#8221; didn&#8217;t raid, alter or otherwise manipulate the Liberal&#8217;s official website. The problem is that the Liberal&#8217;s official website has a slight bug (read: the government can&#8217;t design perfect websites, just like us normal folk) which allows users to insert HTML into the page, in this case it&#8217;s a simple case of inserting something like:</p>

<p><span>code=&#8221;Hack Code&#8221;</span> <script>document.all.middletext.innerHTML = "<center><h1>John Howard says:</h1> "I trust Ryan Bigg, and this election Liberals are prepared to give him a multi-billion dollar budget!"</center></script> <span>/code</span></p>

<p>Simple really. Just copy and paste it after http://www.liberal.org.au/?action=wos.cfm%00%22%3E and you have yourself a nice quote from the PM himself saying that he&#8217;s going to give me lots of money to buy my Ferrari and Trophy Wife.</p>

<p>Back on topic. Journalists do not know how to report.</p>

<p>Earlier this year they stated that a group of hackers from the <span>url=http://valhalla.net.au</span>Monopoly Hackers League<span>/url</span> &#8220;hacked&#8221; the monopoly vote. Strike Two. This group of people included a member who made a program that automatically &#8220;spammed&#8221; the monopoly vote, making SA&#8217;s votes greater than any other states and placing Adelaide and the Barossa Valley on Park Lane and Mayfair. Again, they didn&#8217;t &#8220;hack&#8221; into anything.</p>

<p>I know that more than half the population of Australia are drooling morons (I used to serve them, I would know best), but must the journalists continuously hype their stories up waaaay out of proportion?</p>

<p>No. Report it as it should be reported. No hyping. No overexaggeration. Just the facts, nothing more. This problem is getting more and more rampant. We need more REAL journalists. People who KNOW what they&#8217;re talking about and don&#8217;t sound like they&#8217;re reading from a script or a teleprompter. Don&#8217;t dumb it down either, most of your viewers are adults. This is the age of technology. They&#8217;re hip, they know about these &#8220;ip-ods&#8221; (pronounced: ip-awd, like the ip in &#8220;dip&#8221; and awd as in &#8220;gawd&#8221;).</p>

<p>End of Rant.</p>

<p>On a completely separate topic, according to <span>url=http://blogs.news.com.au/adelaidenow/sa/index.php/adelaidenow/comments/walk_to_work_i_dont_think_so/</span>this post<span>/url</span> I have the legal right to report (read: call the police) other pedestrians that &#8220;impede&#8221; my path. This means you, little old lady with the shopping cart, and YOU, Mr. Business Man talking on his cell phone, both of which are doing 0.5km/h down a walkway.</p>

<p>Valhalla report up soon, and the rest of the photos.</p>}]]></content>

   <title>LPC Report</title>
   <link href="http://ryanbigg.com/2007/10/lpc-report"/>
   <updated>2007-10-08T00:00:00+10:00</updated>
   <id>http://ryanbigg.com/2007/10/lpc-report</id>
   <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Written on the 2nd October:</p>

<p>This is going to be one in a series of lan &#8220;reports&#8221; I&#8217;ll be making for the coming few weeks. September-October seems to be a busy time for LANs where many have them scheduled on the following week from another, or even scheduled on the same day.</p>

<p>LPC (also known as Lan Party Central) is a lan held in Goodwood at the Goodwood Community Centre. 40 people registered for this event on the website (which is something I would like to see the Valhalla website have). LPC suffered from scheduling problems, due to two other LANs and a Nintendo WiFi party also, not to mention the AFL Grand Final on the same day (which Port lost horribly in HAHAHAHAHAHA). Attendance was sub-standard with a layout for around 60 people but only no more than 35 seats filled. The event ran from 10am-11pm with Devastator and I taking out the tournament with no less than a one hundred point lead. I also won the RANDOM door prize.</p>

<p>This LAN party is ran by Michael, Matt, Jamage (Jamie?) and others (whom I&#8217;ve forgotten the names of).</p>

<p>The competitions were:</p>

<ol>
<li>Flatout 2</li>

<li>Warcraft 3 (DotA) cancelled to due lack of interest (aside: hahaha <em>ahem</em>)</li>

<li>Call of Duty 2</li>

<li>Unreal Tournament 2004</li>

<li>Quake 3</li>
</ol>

<p>Unlike a certain other LAN (read: Ragnarok) there was actually a timetable which was strictly kept to throughout the whole day.</p>

<p>Flatout 2 was ill-configured on my PC, with the incorrect settings for the Xbox 360 controller so I was unable to go forward for the first match (all were derby), unable to change out of first in the second, and was finally to participate in the third match, only to come 5th.</p>

<p>The next competition was held much later in the day, at around 6pm. I arrived back from picking up a CD-drive from my house, only to find the competition had begun with only two other competitors. The map was Carentan (personal favourite) and I quickly assumed second position the leaderboard (thanks to my cheersquad for the morale boosting) only to be denied first position by a hacker known as kizmit (who apparently has 400 hours on xfire and therefore has no life). Kizmit took out the competition with 31 frags to my 22 (to my recollection). When I joined I was 12 frags away from kizmit, so it was an alright effort.</p>

<p>Since Devastator attended the lan with no computer (not realising I was going), I let him use mine to play the Quake 3 match after which <em>LINK</em>he complained about using my mouse<em>LINK</em>. Devastator reached the fraglimit of 50 before BigWilly who only trailed by 2 points.</p>

<p>Then there was the Unreal Tournament 2004 competition. Devastator played again, taking a rather clear lead (80 something points at the end of the match <em>THERES A PIC SOMEWHERE</em>) and only needed to win the competition by 25 points in order to claim first place on the leaderboard.</p>

<p>For our efforts we received: AMD Backpack AMD Vest 5 x AMD Stressballs (one of which my Mum&#8217;s dog has now destroyed) AMD screwdriver (which I have now destroyed) Miami Vice PSP Movie (I think I&#8217;m missing something from this list)</p>

<p>There was also an Xbox 360 with Halo 3 on it, two (or three) gamecubes with Super Smash Brothers and Mario Kart: Double Dash on them (I placed 8th in Double Dash, a personal best) and a Wii on which the Wario: Smooth Moves competition was held on. I placed 1st in the mini-games only to have all my ropes cut and therefore be out of the game. There was a huge interest in the console with almost continuous Super Smash Brothers going (in which I did not stand a chance). I cannot wait for Super Smash Brothers for the Wii to come out and even though I am not a &#8220;Nintendo Fan Boy&#8221;, I love the way this game plays.</p>

<p>The LAN wasn&#8217;t as good as I was expecting. I was expecting much more participation in the computer gaming side, something similar to the interest in the consoles. With the Call of Duty 2 competition only attracting three players (two of which were sniper whores, guess who) it seems that this is dying at LAN parties. Counter-Strike: Source received about 8 players, which is still less than what I would usually like to play with it. LPC needs more people to attend, and maybe I just went on a bad time, but it wasn&#8217;t really up to my standard of lanning and the only reason I am going next time is to see if it does improve. If it does, then it might become another regular LAN that I attend.</p>

<p>5/10</p>

<p>The next LAN party I will be attending is Valhalla, which is on the 6th/7th October held at St. Clair Recreation Centre, Woodville. I will have photos up for this report later.</p>}]]></content>

   <title>Rails 2.0</title>

   <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Rails 2.0 Preview Release 1 was released a couple of days ago. The original idea was of this post to go through all the changelogs and find out all the stuff I thought was cool and list it here. The problem is that there&#8217;s too much cool stuff. <span>url=http://blog.rubyonrails.org/2007/9/30/rails-2-0-0-preview-release</span>DHH summed it up quite nicely.<span>/url</span></p>

<p>My favourites are:</p>

<ol>
<li>has_one and has_many for restful routes. For example, <span>term</span>map.resources :forums, :has_many =&gt; :topics<span>/term</span>.</li>

<li>Sexy migrations.</li>

<li>The way it loads faster, mashing all the javascript/css into one file so it only gets two files (one for js, one for css) instead of 6 or 7.</li>

<li>Instead of specifying <span>term</span>topic_path(@topic)<span>/term</span> for a topics path, now you can do <span>term</span>topic_path<span>/term</span> and Rails will know what you&#8217;re talking about.</li>
</ol>

<p>One thing I&#8217;m annoyed at is that routes like <span>term</span>forum_edit_topic_path(forum,topic) <span>/term</span> to edit a topic now become: <span>term</span>edit_forum_topic_path(forum,topic)<span>/term</span> Going through each page and finding all the routes that use this will be a pain, and I&#8217;m considering making a small ruby script to do it for me.</p>

<p>TOMORROW, I hope to get the LPC report up!</p>}]]></content>

   <title>The Camera Saga</title>
   <link href="http://ryanbigg.com/2007/10/the-camera-saga"/>
   <updated>2007-10-03T00:00:00+10:00</updated>
   <id>http://ryanbigg.com/2007/10/the-camera-saga</id>
   <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I was talking with my brother about him wanting to buy a new camera about a month or two ago but him not having the money. I looked at the Fuji Finepix 9100 which is just a slight upgrade from my Fuji Finepix 5600 and I loved it. I looked on eBay only to find that one was listed too expensive for my tastes.</p>

<p>A few weeks later, I <span>url=http://cgi.ebay.com.au/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&amp;rd=1&amp;item=220137983380&amp;ssPageName=STRK:MEWN:IT&amp;ih=012</span>found this one.<span>/url</span> Little did I know of the hell I had to go through to get it. $80 postage was OK I thought, as long as it arrived within the stated 1-3 days. First of all, contacting the buyer to get the account details. This was a rally of about 6 emails to get all the information needed to transfer to his bank account. This is because I could not transfer money to a Hong Kong bank account using my internet banking provided by CommunityCPS. So, I got all the information and eventually was slugged with a $55 telegraphic transfer fee by my bank. So now it&#8217;s cost me $630 for this camera, and it still has to arrive.</p>

<p>I respect the fact there was a weekend between the 27th (when the seller notified me the item was sent off) and today, but the item listing CLEARLY states 1-3 days shipping $80, thus I expect it to be here within 1-3 days (yeah, I&#8217;m ignoring the fine print. This is not a peak season like Christmas). It&#8217;s now been 5 business days (including the Labor day public holiday) and I really want that camera for Valhalla.</p>

<p><em>sigh</em> Next time I&#8217;m just going to fork out the money and buy it from a retailer so I have it immediately in hand. This experience has turned me off eBay.</p>}]]></content>

   <title>How to Work Out if a Date is a Leap Year in Ruby</title>

   <id>http://ryanbigg.com/2007/10/how-to-work-out-if-a-date-is-a-leap-year-in-ruby</id>
   <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Angus asked me today to code him a method in Ruby to work out if a date is a leap year. He gave his example:</p>

<p><span>code=&#8221;Angus&#8217;s Example&#8221;</span> if not (year % 4) and ((year % 100) or not ((year % 100) or (year % 400))) <span>/code</span></p>

<p><em>tut tuts Angus, use ! instead of not, &amp;&amp; instead of and, and || instead of or!</em></p>

<p>Ruby has this built in method called <span>term</span>leap?<span>/term</span> and its source looks like this:</p>

<p><span>code=&#8221;Ruby&#8217;s Source&#8221;</span> def leap? self.class.jd_to_civil(self.class.civil_to_jd(year, 3, 1, ns?) - 1, ns?)<span>-1</span> == 29 end <span>/code</span></p>

<p>Now I&#8217;m sure there&#8217;s a reason they&#8217;re doing all that, but I have a shorter way:</p>

<p><span>code=&#8221;My Code&#8221;</span> class Date def leap? yday != 60 end end <span>/code</span></p>

<p><span>term</span>yday<span>/term</span> returns 60 on all years that are not leap years, so why not just check that value?</p>}]]></content>

   <title>Why Not To: Ever Underestimate The Simplest Of Tasks</title>

   <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Being it a long weekend and being me not having anything to do on the weekend, I decided that I should put my Windows installation on the spare 320GB drive I won from InLAN from the 200GB drive I originally planned to give to Devastator in exchange for headphones he won. It sounds simple, just make a backup using something like Norton Ghost, and then write that to the new drive.</p>

<p>I didn&#8217;t use Ghost.</p>

<p>I used DriveClone, a program that Devastator won at InLan (seeing a pattern here?) and that <em>seemed</em> to work.</p>

<p>Until I tried to boot off the drive.</p>

<p><span>code</span> NTLDR is missing Press Ctrl+Alt+Del to Restart <span>/code</span></p>

<p>WONDERFUL!</p>

<p>So I do what I usually do when I get that error message, in this order: 1) Growl in frustration. 2) Pull the power cable out and switch it off. 3) Simmer for about 30 seconds. 4) Plug the power cable back in and switch it back on.</p>

<p>Then it usually works, and it did this time too. Then Windows got all the way up to the welcome screen and stopped. No accounts, no login box, nada. Just the welcome screen.</p>

<p>WONDERFUL!</p>

<p>So I plugged the old harddrive back in, did ANOTHER clone using DriveClone (which, if Dev doesn&#8217;t want it I will run over with my car because each clone only takes an hour) and tried again.</p>

<p>This time it got straight to the Windows welcome screen again. No accounts, no login box, nada.</p>

<p>WONDERFUL!</p>

<p>Ok. By this time I was mildly annoyed (read: anything that was not bolted down had the potential to be thrown across the room at great speed and inaccuracy) so I went and played on the Xbox 360 for a little while whilst thinking about what the hell I could do.</p>

<p>I settled on finally installing Windows, just Windows XP w/ Service Pack 2, to the 320GB drive. That worked. It booted. I rejoiced. I was HAPPY.</p>

<p>Then I wanted to copy over my files.</p>

<p>So I went into what I thought was the most important, my pictures directory. Only when I went to D:\Documents and Settings\Radar it said &#8220;Access Denied&#8221;.</p>

<p>WONDERFUL!</p>

<p>I then found out on the internet that if you go into Tools -&gt; Options -&gt; View and then right down the bottom of the list of checkboxes is &#8220;Use simple file sharing (recommended)&#8221; and if you turn it off then you can claim ownership of any folder, as long as you were Administrator. Thanks to the default Windows XP install, I was Administrator and not-so-quickly (thanks Windows!) gained ownership of the folders. I copied them over and then got all my music and did something that will surprise you.</p>

<p>I BACKED UP.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s right. I used Windows built-in backing up feature and backed up my old drive. Now all that&#8217;s left to do is to install everything. Again.</p>

   <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I feel sorry for the people who code in Java and you should too. Their &#8220;hello world&#8221; program is 5 lines long, 5 times longer than Ruby&#8217;s. Not only do you have to write out five lines, but then you have to compile and then execute it.</p>

<p>(all Java examples stolen from the <span>url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_%28programming_language%29</span>Java (programming language) page<span>/url</span></p>

<p>Ruby&#8217;s Hello World on one line:</p>

<p><span>code=&#8221;Ruby: Hello World (irb)&#8221;</span> puts &#8220;hello world&#8221; <span>/code</span></p>

<p>And then how about this example in order to tell if a number is odd or even:</p>

<p><span>code=&#8221;Java: Odd Or Even&#8221;</span> public class OddEven { private int input;</p>

<pre><code>public OddEven() {

        System.out.println(&quot;Even&quot;);
    else
        System.out.println(&quot;Odd&quot;);
}

public static void main(String[] args) {
    OddEven number = new OddEven();
    number.calculate();
}</code></pre>

<p>} <span>/code</span></p>

   <title>I Hate Banks</title>
   <link href="http://ryanbigg.com/2007/09/i-hate-banks"/>
   <updated>2007-09-15T00:00:00+10:00</updated>
   <id>http://ryanbigg.com/2007/09/i-hate-banks</id>
   <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>You&#8217;ve recently selected to buy something from eBay and to do so you need to transfer money from your account to a Hong Kong bank account. Thankfully, you think, there&#8217;s this little thing called the Internet which has Internet Banking on it so you decide you would go to use that.</p>

<p>After about 20 minutes of frustration by realising the person who was selling you the item did not give you a BSB number, You decide to call the bank&#8217;s number. First you get a &#8220;For account enquries please press 1&#8221; and so on. This is not welcoming. Eventually the LAST option (option #5), general enquiries, is the one you want. You press that and instantly you&#8217;re transported into a world of pain listening to the relaxing &#8220;music&#8221; they play when you&#8217;re on hold and the stupid voice overs that tell you about all the &#8220;great&#8221; things about the bank.</p>

<p>Eventually you&#8217;re put on to a real person. You tell them what you want to do and they nearly trip over themselves trying to help you. They go through a list of about 9 things you need. You have the first 8. The 9th is an IBAN or International Bank Account Number, which my seller did NOT provide me with. You ask them if it is possible to work it out from the information you&#8217;ve given them. They say no. You politely thank them for their help and you hang up in frustration. You pick up a random object and throw it across the room. In this day and age why is it so hard to send money across the world? WE HAVE THE INTERNET FOR GOD&#8217;S SAKE.</p>

<p>The next day, a Saturday, after running some errands you realise that it&#8217;s 11am and, thinking that the bank shuts at 12pm, you are in no particular rush. Out of interest you get home, go online and check to make sure the bank is where you think it is, only to see the closing time is actually 11:30am, and not 12pm. You race out the door and nearly forget to lock it. You speed off down the street nearly cleaning up the cars on both sides of the road and as you&#8217;re about to turn right to get out of the estate an old man driving a tiny car drives by. Doing 40.</p>

<p>You estimate that it&#8217;ll take you 20 minutes to reach the bank, doing the legal speed limit of course, but if you&#8217;re stuck behind this guy for any longer you probably won&#8217;t make it to the bank because you&#8217;ll: a) Park yourself in his boot b) Get pulled over for overtaking at higher speeds than what is most probably legal, all the while holding one hand on your horn and steering wheel and the other giving a one fingered salute.</p>

<p>You eventually decide that waiting for the guy to get off the road is most probably a good idea because you know within 5 minutes you will be on a 3-lane-wide main road in which you will be able to overtake the guy at 80 whilst he&#8217;s still doing 50. You tailgate this 4 foot, balding, head-super-close-to-the-steering-wheel asshole for the next five minutes, supressing the urge to smash into his right-back-side and spin him out of control so you can get to the damn bank, regardless of how much damage it would do to your 1986 Holden VL.</p>

<p>Finally you reach the main road! Only, most of the people on it think that it&#8217;s Sunday and drive like it&#8217;s a national day of mourning. You decide sticking to the speed limit is a good idea, since the cop in the left lane probably wouldn&#8217;t aid your cause if you decided to break the speed limit. You hang back, just behind the cop and in the lane next to him. Overtaking him is, to him, seen as a threat and he&#8217;ll probably pull you over for that bald front-left tyre and absolutely atrocious music you were playing. Eventually the cop turns off to the left and you carry on your merry way to the bank.</p>

<p>You reach the carpark. It is full. There are people in no rush what so ever holding the trolley with one hand and scolding their feral kids as they dawdle across the car park in front of you. Honestly, who would win? Your VL or a crappy aluminium trolley? They move off to the side and you plant your foot, but only enough for the wheels to spin for two seconds, and take a sharp left into the next column of the car park. You spy a park but some asshole&#8217;s already waiting and the guy pulling out of it doesn&#8217;t look like he&#8217;s going to be doing it any time this week. You look at the clock, mocking you from it&#8217;s position on your dashboard slowly ticking away, 11:18. You take the next column of parking and find that there&#8217;s not one, but TWO spots free. You don&#8217;t care what&#8217;s coming from what direction, you smack the indicator arm up and turn the wheel and park your car.</p>

<p>You enter the shopping centre and, since it&#8217;s a shopping centre you haven&#8217;t been in lately, you look for a map. There isn&#8217;t one, of course, so you walk around looking for this bloody bank and eventually stumble into it. The highly-motivated (read: not) employee on the other side of the inch thick plastic gives a mumbled &#8220;hello&#8221; and you mention that you would like to deposit some coins into your bank account. &#8220;Can I have your card please?&#8221; she asks. You hand her the card and then start taking the coins out of your bag. Once you&#8217;re done you zip up the bag and look up, only to meet with the iciest stare, you&#8217;re stopping her from going home. She weighs up whether or not to take your coinage and pelt you with it or to count it up. She decides that it&#8217;s not worth the effort to cause you bodily harm so she carries it all over to the little weighing machine they have. She weighs it all up and says that some of the bags didn&#8217;t have the right amount of coinage in it and the total was only $119.90. You mention you have one more order of business and as you reach into your bag you can just make out a sigh coming from the direction of the teller. You produce a piece of paper with all the account details on it for the international bank account and vaguely mention you want an IBAN number. She tells you that there is no way to work out an IBAN number from that information.</p>

<p>You leave the bank disappointed. You come home and google &#8220;IBAN Hong Kong Calculator&#8221; and find that there <span>url=http://creativeeyes.at/tools/iban</span>is a site that actually works out IBANs for you<span>/url</span> and you use that. You phone up the number again, this time knowing what to do to get a human to talk to you faster only to be told you can&#8217;t transfer money internationally because they don&#8217;t do that on the weekend.</p>}]]></content>

   <title>I Has A Keyboards!</title>
   <link href="http://ryanbigg.com/2007/09/i-has-a-keyboards"/>
   <updated>2007-09-12T00:00:00+10:00</updated>
   <id>http://ryanbigg.com/2007/09/i-has-a-keyboards</id>
   <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Last week I saw a Rollup Keyboard on eBay and after wanting to try one for a while, I decided to buy it. After hearing &#8220;rave reviews&#8221; about how crappy it is, I REALLY wanted to try one and was happy to pay the $16.95 to buy it and get it posted to me.</p>

<p>Today it arrived. I was overjoyed, but food had to be eaten and my stomach was trying to devour itself, so I ate a lovely Ravioli first. During the course of eating the Ravioli I tried multi-tasking. This involved eating and attempting to type on the keyboard. Grab forkful of Ravioli, put in mouth and chew, type something, swallow Ravioli, repeat.</p>

<p>Let me start by saying this keyboard is&#8230; different. It has <span>url=&#8217;/images/rollup-keyboard/four-shift-keys.jpg&#8217;</span>four shift keys (two on each side)<span>/url</span>, <span>url=&#8217;/images/rollup-keyboard/two-space-keys.jpg&#8217;</span>two space keys<span>/url</span>, <span>url=&#8217;/images/rollup-keyboard/two-enter-keys.jpg&#8217;</span>two enter keys<span>/url</span> and <span>url=&#8217;/images/rollup-keyboard/two-blank-keys.jpg&#8217;</span>two blank keys that do nothing at all<span>/url</span>. However, it comes with a USB connector with a PS2 adapter attached, handy for plugging it into either socket. It&#8217;s automatically recognised by Windows, which is also a plus. It is also extremely quiet, with I would say at least 10 times less noise than my G15.</p>

<p>A few downsides are that it has <span>url=&#8217;images/rollup-keyboard/caps-lock.jpg&#8217;</span>this very bright red light<span>/url</span> which the company who manufactured the keyboard appears to have borrowed from the Terminator&#8217;s eye socket. The backspace key is about three keys further away than what I&#8217;m used to, thanks to the insertion of insert, del and pause/break keys. It&#8217;s also one key DOWN from the top-right edge of the keyboard where you would usually find it. Typing on it you have to press harder than expected and more accurately than you would on a usual keyboard, not that I type with any accuracy at the moment. ; Here is me using it during a sandstorm just like the product description says</p>
<object height='350' width='425'> <param name='movie' value='http://www.youtube.com/v/H2FYiBZ1StQ'> </param> <embed src='http://www.youtube.com/v/H2FYiBZ1StQ' type='application/x-shockwave-flash' height='350' width='425'> </embed> </object>
<p>You&#8217;ll need sound for the full comic effect. The song in the background is Sandstorm by Darude.</p>

<p>If you are a novice keyboard user and look at the keys when typing, I recommend you buy this keyboard. It&#8217;s light, portable and seems useful in a way. If you are an advanced user however who does not look at the keys, you might be used to being able to touch the keys not quite in the direct center, and therefore you might find you make many more spelling mistakes on this keyboard than you would its larger, noiser brothers.</p>

<p>5/10</p>

<p>After initially writing this blog and using the keyboard for work I realised the total absence of both a Home and an End key. I wouldn&#8217;t mind if the two blank keys performed this action, but they don&#8217;t. It&#8217;s surprising how much you notice you need the home and end keys when you don&#8217;t have them.</p>}]]></content>

   <title>RESTful Routes</title>
   <link href="http://ryanbigg.com/2007/09/restful-routes"/>
   <updated>2007-09-10T00:00:00+10:00</updated>
   <id>http://ryanbigg.com/2007/09/restful-routes</id>
   <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Eventually I hope to integrate this into the guide, but here it is.</p>

<p>RESTful routing makes it easier to link to the actions within controllers without having to repetitively type out code such as <span>term</span>:controller =&gt; &#8220;blogs&#8221;, :action =&gt; &#8220;show&#8221;, :id =&gt; blog.id<span>/term</span> every time you want to link to that specific action. RESTful routing also forces you into a CRUD convention (which may seem bad at first), but if someone reads your code they know what each action does. Restful routing, by default, employs seven actions within every controller, namely New, Create, Edit, Update, Destroy, Show and Index. These are the seven basic actions of your controller which nearly every controller uses. It also employs two more HTTP request methods, beside GET and POST, called PUT and DELETE.</p>

<p>We&#8217;re already have our blogs controller but we need to define a new line in our config/routes.rb</p>

<p><span>code=&#8221;config/routes.rb&#8221;</span> map.resources :blogs <span>/code</span></p>

<p>If we wanted to make a link to the blogs index somewhere, like application.rhtml, we would define it like so:</p>

<p><span>code=&#8221;app/views/layouts/application.rhtml&#8221;</span> &lt;%= link_to(&#8220;Blogs&#8221;, blogs_path) %&gt; <span>/code</span></p>

<p>This tells Rails that we want all the blogs, indicated by the pluralization of the word &#8220;blog&#8221;, and we don&#8217;t need to specify any further actions.</p>

<p>The line tells Rails that we want to make that controller RESTful. Previously, we have used <span>term</span>:controller =&gt; &#8220;blogs&#8221;, :action =&gt; &#8220;show&#8221;, :id =&gt; blog.id<span>/term</span> to go to a specific blog. Thanks to RESTful routing, all we now need to type is something like:</p>

<p><span>code=&#8221;app/views/_blog.rhtml&#8221;</span> <pre class='markdown-html-error' style='border: solid 3px red; background-color: pink'>REXML could not parse this XML/HTML: 
&lt;h2&gt;</pre></p>

<p>This <span>term</span>link_to<span>/term</span> would use RESTful routing to take us to the blog. The way it does this is that it sees that it&#8217;s a standard link, so the HTTP request method is GET by default. It then sees that we want the path to a blog, defined by the singularisation of our controller which indicates we only want one blog. Finally, in the argument list after it we specify which blog. This can be the blog object itself (as shown in the example), or it could be <span>term</span>blog.id<span>/term</span>.</p>

<p>To make a link to edit the blog, we call the method <span>term</span>edit_blog_path<span>/term</span> and specify the argument, which again can either be the blog object or the blog id, like this <span>term</span>edit_blog_path(blog)<span>/term</span> or <span>term</span>edit_blog_path(blog.id)<span>/term</span>. This will link us to <span>term</span>blogs/1;edit<span>/term</span>. This tells you simply that you&#8217;re looking at the first blog, indicated by <span>term</span>blogs/1<span>/term</span> and that you are performing the edit action on it, indicated by the <span>term</span>;edit<span>/term</span>.</p>

<p>Once we get to the edit form then we need to go to the update action. Here we would usually specify something like <span>term</span>:controller =&gt; &#8220;blogs&#8221;, :action =&gt; &#8220;update&#8221;, :id =&gt; @blog.id<span>/term</span> but not today! Instead we specify the form like:</p>

<p><span>code=&#8221;app/views/blogs/edit.rhtml&#8221;</span> &lt;% form_for :blog, @blog, :url =&gt; blog_path(blog), :html =&gt; { :method =&gt; &#8220;put&#8221; } do |f| %&gt; <span>/code</span></p>

<p>This says that we&#8217;re using the blog object, to go to the url of a single blog. Now here&#8217;s where it&#8217;ll get confusing. Before I&#8217;ve said that <span>term</span>blog_path(blog)<span>/term</span> goes straight to the show action within the blogs controller. Well, don&#8217;t worry, it still does. Just in this example I&#8217;ve specified <span>term</span>:html =&gt; { :method =&gt; &#8220;put&#8221; }<span>/term</span> which uses one of those custom HTTP request methods we saw earlier and instead of going to the show action it now goes to the update action.</p>

<p>Finally there&#8217;ll be a case where a blog isn&#8217;t just cutting it any more and we have to destroy it. This is where we use the final HTTP custom request method, <span>term</span>DELETE<span>/term</span>. To destroy a blog we specify a URL like <span>term</span>link_to &#8220;Destroy&#8221;, blog_path, :method =&gt; &#8220;delete&#8221;<span>/term</span>. Again, because we&#8217;ve specifed the method delete it doesn&#8217;t go to the show action, but the destroy action.</p>

<p>Now we want to define a new RESTful route for the comments for a particular blog and for that we&#8217;re going to define a nested route. This is just a route definition inside a route definition and isn&#8217;t really as tricky as it sounds.</p>

<p>In the routes.rb file replace <span>term</span>map.resources :blogs<span>/term</span> with:</p>

<p><span>code=&#8221;config/routes.rb&#8221;</span> map.resources &#8220;blogs&#8221; do |blog| blog.resources &#8216;comments&#8217; end map.resources &#8216;comments&#8217; <span>/code</span></p>

<p>Notice how we have defined the route for comments twice. This is because we can either reference it by the blog&#8217;s nested route or by itself like <span>term</span>/comments/1<span>/term</span> to see the comment with the ID of 1.</p>

<p>This simply defines that we can call a route like /blogs/1/comments and ideally we would define something like the following in the comments controller:</p>

<p><span>code=&#8221;app/controllers/comments_controller.rb&#8221;</span> def index @comments = Comment.find_by_blog_id(params<span>:blog_id</span>) end <span>/code</span></p>

<p>to get the comments for that particular blog. We can also now call methods like <span>term</span>comments_path<span>/term</span> to get all the comments universally or <span>term</span>comments_path(blog)<span>/term</span> to get all the comments for a particular blog.</p>

<p>To specify a custom action you can put <span>term</span>:member =&gt; { :custom =&gt; :get }<span>/term</span> after the route definition to make it something like <span>term</span>map.resources :blogs, :member =&gt; { :custom =&gt; :get }<span>/term</span> Which will let you access the custom action by calling <span>term</span>custom_blog_path(blog)<span>/term</span>. To define something where you don&#8217;t need to pass in a blog argument, use <span>term</span>:collection<span>/term</span> instead of <span>term</span>:member<span>/term</span>, like this: <span>term</span>:collection =&gt; { :custom =&gt; :get }<span>/term</span>. To define subsequent actions within these hashes, simply separate them with a comma <span>term</span>:collection =&gt; { :custom =&gt; :get, :other =&gt; :post }<span>/term</span> The symbol after the points to (<span>term</span>=&gt;<span>/term</span>) is the HTTP request method by which the page is requested. You can use get, post, put or delete.</p>}]]></content>

(9:16:18 PM) Radar: I figure, if Satan is the &#8220;Prince of Darkness&#8221; and supposed to be opposite to God, then god must be the &#8220;Princess&#8221; (9:16:19 PM) Tom: whos she? (9:16:30 PM) Tom: lol i see (9:16:37 PM) Radar: You&#8217;ve been insulting her. (9:16:39 PM) Radar: She&#8217;ll be pissed. (9:16:42 PM) Tom: lol (9:16:48 PM) Radar: No wonder why she&#8217;s smote so many humans. (9:16:52 PM) Tom: now that&#8217;s a different way of looking at it <span>/quote</span></p>

   <id>http://ryanbigg.com/2007/09/the-bike-ride</id>
   <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today for Father&#8217;s Day my dad and I rode <span>url=http://frozenplague.net/images/other/ride-2092007.jpg</span>this distance<span>/url</span> where 1cm is 500m.</p>

<p>In the future I hope to do a bike ride that my friend Ray and I did, which was down the River Torrens Pathway to the mouth, across to West Lakes and back up to Adelaide using Port Road (which just so happens to have the slightest incline and really kills you). The ride is about 30 kilometres long and <span>url=http://www.frozenplague.net/images/other/proposed-ride.jpg</span>goes something like this.<span>/url</span> On the lower right of the image where all the black lines converge is the train station.</p>

<p>Consider this an open invite. If you&#8217;re fit and willing to come, meet at the train station in town at midday (12pm, for the slow among you) in three weeks and bring your bike.</p>

<p>People Who Are Interested:</p>

<ol>
<li>Me</li>

<li>Tom</li>

<li>Dad</li>

<li>Ray</li>
</ol>

<p>People I should ask:</p>

<ol>
<li>Paul</li>

<li>Eyerc people</li>
</ol>

<p>People who aren&#8217;t going:</p>

   <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Thanks to AgentGreasy&#8217;s &#8220;uber-leet mad skillz&#8221; this blog is now running on Rails. I decided to use Rails for my blog because it doesn&#8217;t show me as a hypocrite for using something else and shows that Rails can be as good as any other programming language out there.</p>

<p>Yes the Upcoming Events box is ugly and yes I will fix it.</p>

<p>I can now use Chronic which lets me say stuff like &#8220;two days from next tuesday 2pm&#8221; and it gives back <span>chronic</span>two days from next tuesday 2pm<span>/chronic</span>. Cool, huh?</p>

<p>Also this blog lets me define code blocks:</p>

<p><span>code=&#8221;app/non-existant.rb&#8221;</span> if i.rule puts &#8220;Rails isn&#8217;t broken!&#8221; else puts &#8220;Rails is broken!&#8221; end <span>/code</span></p>

<p>and some cool little span thingies that I can put methods in like <span>term</span>reject<span>/term</span> and my custom destroy method, <span>term</span>obliterate<span>/term</span></p>
<hr />
<p>And now a fictional story, based on true events and events that I would like to see happen.</p>

<p>I was catching the train into town enjoying tapping away on my laptop and listening to my iPod when this obnoxious Italian kid gets on bored with his mate with no tickets. They start talking loudly, as Italians do, and I quickly get annoyed. So I turn up my iPod a little louder and keep tapping away resisting the urge to throw them both out the train whilst it&#8217;s still going. I&#8217;m about to snap and one of them approaches the door. I think he&#8217;s about to get off. He opens the door whilst the train&#8217;s still moving. He invites TWO MORE of his friends into the train and all four of them are now talking obnoxiously loud, as Italians do. I resist the urge to throw one of them under the train until we get to Adelaide.</p>

<p>The next day felt like deja vu. Same guys, same obnoxious talking (&#8220;Yous gotta learns to fight doods!&#8221;) and same temptation to throw them out the train. I hatch a plan and smile slightly to myself knowing the following days are going to be better. That night I phone up AdelaideMetro and tell them some regular commuters are boarding without tickets.</p>

<p>The following day a short woman with grey hair and a huge guy board the train wearing orange AdelaideMetro vests. &#8220;Tickets please&#8221; she says as she walks down the aisle towards the obnoxious Italians, checking all the commuter&#8217;s tickets. The Italians start to panic. With no money they try to go to the next carriage and find the door&#8217;s locked. &#8220;Going somewhere?&#8221; the huge guy says, coming from nowhere. &#8220;Yeah man, our friends are in the front carriage but the door is jammed.&#8221;, the &#8216;leader&#8217; nervously says to the guard. &#8220;The door&#8217;s locked, you&#8217;re going nowhere. Names and addresses please, gentlemen.&#8221; &#8220;I lost my ticket&#8221; one lies to the guard. Now the guard&#8217;s pissed. &#8220;Bullshit. Names and addresses or I&#8217;ll throw you out now.&#8221; The guard replies, cornering them with his sheer size. He notes their information down in a notepad and makes them stand by the door.</p>

<p>They are escorted off at the next station.</p>

<p>At the next station his two friends board and are asked for their tickets. The guard escorts them off at the station after that.</p>

<p>Ahh, sweet justice.</p>}]]></content>

   <updated>2007-08-28T00:00:00+10:00</updated>
   <id>http://ryanbigg.com/2007/08/august-lan-event</id>
   <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Whilst this LAN was very close to the last one (almost exactly a month beforehand) attendance was good. Setup was done exceptionally quickly with, as Wookie stated &#8220;four times as many people as we needed&#8221;, and was finished at around 10:30. I arrived with <span>url=http://www.frozenplague.net/images/valhalla/august/cameron.jpg</span>ShadowCamsy<span>/url</span> and <span>url=http://www.frozenplague.net/images/valhalla/august/devastator-lanning.jpg</span>Devastator<span>/url</span>. I helped Moogie set up the <span>url=http://www.frozenplague.net/images/valhalla/august/cool-poster.jpg</span>posters<span>/url</span> showing the details of the October 6th-7th LAN.</p>

<p>We let the lanners in a few (2) minutes early for a change and I played door bitch for about half an hour handing out the pink wriststraps before substituting my position with <span>url=http://www.frozenplague.net/images/valhalla/august/the-aussie-bogan-sausages.jpg</span>TheAussieBogan<span>/url</span> who substituted his position with <span>url=http://www.frozenplague.net/images/valhalla/august/commander-el.jpg</span>CommanderEl.<span>/url</span> Before I could settle down my friend Paul called and wanted me to give him his ticket so he could get in.</p>

<p><span>url=http://www.frozenplague.net/images/valhalla/august/wookie.jpg</span>Wookie<span>/url</span> was his usual &#8220;sunshine and lollipops&#8221; self, issuing orders (and lollipops, I&#8217;m serious), and threatening physical violence upon those who dared to cross him. Then his computer decided to <span>url=http://www.frozenplague.net/images/valhalla/august/wookie-screen.jpg</span>screw itself over<span>/url</span> and eventually replaced the motherboard which was found to be faulty.</p>

<p><span>url=http://www.frozenplague.net/images/valhalla/august/sausages.jpg</span>Sausages<span>/url</span> were plentiful and free, with many lanners opting to have the non-charcoal sausages provided by TheAussieBogan and his minions. The St. Clair Recreation Centre&#8217;s canteen also provided toasted ham &amp; cheese sandwiches, which I suspect also contained epic win. Not bad for $2.50.</p>

<p><span>url=http://www.frozenplague.net/images/valhalla/august/red-bull-girls.jpg</span>The Redbull Girls<span>/url</span> also dropped in, doubling Valhalla&#8217;s girl population with their presence. They handed out free Red Bull to all lanners.</p>

<p>There were <span>url=http://www.frozenplague.net/images/valhalla/august/prizes-1.jpg</span>many<span>/url</span>many<span>/url</span>prizes<span>/url</span>. <span>url=http://www.frozenplague.net/images/valhalla/august/sub-1208.jpg</span>At 12:08pm, SuB-ZeRo (centre)<span>/url</span> was playing Tekken 5, <span>url=http://www.frozenplague.net/images/valhalla/august/sub-2048.jpg</span>and at 8:48pm (posing like a retard, center)<span>/url</span>Sub was still playing the PS3. <span>url=http://www.frozenplague.net/images/valhalla/august/sub-tekken-5.jpg</span>He won a Thermaltake Fan for the PS3 competition.<span>/url</span>Some noobs played Garry&#8217;s Mod, singleplayer.<span>/url</span>Kyorisu won a competition, I don&#8217;t know which one it was but he won something.<span>/url</span> Believe it or not, <span>url=http://www.frozenplague.net/images/valhalla/august/mittens.jpg</span>Mittens<span>/url</span> and <span>url=http://www.frozenplague.net/images/valhalla/august/unholee.jpg</span>Unholee<span>/url</span> both won at least one competition each. Also equally shocking was <span>url=http://www.frozenplague.net/images/valhalla/august/seq-won-css-for-the-billionth-time-in-a-row.jpg</span>sequential gaming<span>/url</span> taking out the CS:S competition for the &#8220;18th time in a row&#8221;. The <span>url=http://www.frozenplague.net/images/valhalla/august/sic-guys-won-ut2k4.jpg</span>Sharing is Caring team<span>/url</span> took out the UT2k4 competition.</p>

<p>I started playing QW:ET at 1pm and before I knew it people were asking me when I was going to get pizza, at 7:30. There needs to be a competition for this game once it comes out. Shame about the map repetitiveness. I went and got 25 pizzas for the lanners, during the course of which a girl at the pizza shop had a tantrum because she &#8220;couldn&#8217;t pre-sauce that many pizzas&#8221;. Arrived back with 25 pizzas which all disappeared pretty quickly.</p>

<p>Basketball was played on the bigger courts with a bunch of noobs (seems I didn&#8217;t get a picture!), taking that out and winning absolutely nothing.</p>

<p>I ran a Soldat competition in which a whole 9 people played in, and Mittens took it out with a 20-something point lead over Tetsu and Cyanara.</p>}]]></content>

   <title>The Crisis in Adelaide</title>

   <updated>2007-08-27T00:00:00+10:00</updated>
   <id>http://ryanbigg.com/2007/08/the-crisis-in-adelaide</id>
   <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><span>url=http://www.valhalla.net.au/forum/viewtopic.php?t=8414</span>Taken from the Valhalla forums post by Wookie<span>/url</span></p>

<p>&#8212;- Original Message &#8212;&#8211; From: Jason Lassey To: minister.conlon@saugov.sa.gov.au ; premier@saugov.sa.gov.au Sent: Monday, August 27, 2007 7:41 PM Subject: The Adelaide-Brighton &#8220;Express&#8221; Train</p>

<p>Dear Premier and Minister,</p>

<p>As one of the many unfortunates who labour so very hard in the salt mines that constitute local employment in this city, and as one of those borderline poverty cases that consistently vote labour in the vain hope that democracy actually works for the people, and as one of the few innocents left in this plane of existence who still believe that the governments duty is to provide a certain standard of service to the voting peasants, I had the misfortune to catch the so-called &#8216;express&#8217; train from Adelaide Railway Station to Brighton. 12 years ago, South Australia was &#8220;Going all the way&#8221;, unfortunately for those killed or maimed by the ancient railway system per year arent going anywhere. Its enough to make John Olsen roll over in his political grave.</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>5000 years ago man began inventing new and interesting ways to get around faster and more efficiently. After successfully domesticating the horse, it was rapidly adapted to travel via riding. Over the millenia this obsession with convenient transportation moved from simple riding to chariots and carts. Obviously it was one of these horses that was pulling my express train from the city to brighton last tuesday and again this morning. When i got off the train I checked the exterior and could have sworn I saw &#8220;Cobb &amp; Co&#8221; stencilled on the outside.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Back in the late 19th century Charles Atlas was able to pull a locomotive several feet by himself, and as the train stopped for perhaps the seventieth time on the &#8220;express&#8221; route, it was perfectly natural to assume that perhaps these were in fact rest stops for the man who was pulling the train. I assumed that this may have been part of some fuel saving exercise, which while commendable given the pollution output of some of these trains, is not conducive to efficient travel for the weary voters of this fairest of cities.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>I thought that perhaps in peak periods to bolster the fleet even further that the South Australian government might be using a steam engine to pull the express train, although I&#8217;ve been on Puffing Billy and it was a lot faster than the train I was on. Its somewhat disturbing to watch yourself be overtaken by an elderly gentlemen riding a model train at one point.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>The only other possible explanation is that the train would fire up to gain momentum, and then shut the engine off and try to roll while still moving, this while an explanation of why the train would stop and rev the be-jesus out of its engine periodically, is not really an acceptable standard in the transportation industry,</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>I would like to point out that if Coles ran their express checkout lanes like Adelaide Metro run the trains, it would take hours to progress through the 12 items or less section, with checkouts randomly shutting down without explanation and sitting still for several minutes at a time before moving several feet and doing it again.</p>

<p>Now Im not one to complain normally but as public transport is - at least in theory - a government organisation, and its somewhat disturbing to me that while Mussolini could apparently get the trains running on time, 62 years later we appear to be taking giant steps backward. Its entirely possible that these trains are the actual ones that Mussolini used, given their age and condition. Personally I believe that the utilisation of these older trains to bolster the puiblic transport network is a thinly veiled attempt to solve problems elsewhere. Consider:</p>

<p>The more people that fall through the &#8220;accidental&#8221; random door openings, are less people that require health treatment in our ever deplorable public health system. These same &#8220;accidents&#8221; will also reduce the number of people looking for new land to develop housing and will reduce the strain on water consumption and electricity use. It also eliminates potential undesirables from the ghetto sections of Adelaide. Its worth noticing that the train lines only run to the bogan sections of Adelaide - ie. the Elizabeth line, Noarlunga Line and Port Adelaide line. I almost guarantee that if there was a Magill line or something going east for the more affluent of the city&#8217;s citizenry that such acts of randomness would be dealt with swiftly and decisively.</p>

<p>While the aforementioned reasons would take some time before they come into any meaningful effect - one or two deaths a year would be barely noticeable - when you combine it with other existing methods, like black deaths in custody, drugs and port adelaide choking in finals, you have a very sufficient form of population cleansing. At the very least, it should go someway to alleviate any overcrowding in these areas.</p>

<p>It is somewhat of an issue that the trains being pressed into service were originally constructed by a giant emu in the Aboriginal dream time, were dug up by archaeologists and now serve as a primary mode of transport. Whilst somethings get better with age - wine, cheese, the Olsen twins - this is not a good quality in a primary transport infrastructure.</p>

<p>Of course any good letter should contain a solution to these problems, not just criticism. So how do we deal with the situation?</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>Of course the first and foremost solution is to build a mono-rail. Without question, a modern and popular mode of transport introduced into Australia during the Wolrd Expo 1988 in Brisbane, would enliven several areas of Adelaide where the only relief from the mundane, pointless existence is when the price of a case of woodstock dips below the $15 mark.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Extend the tram line out to these areas. Since the state government is in love with the tram system at the moment, and is planning to relay the track belween the city and Noarlunga anyway&#8230;make it a tram line!</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>A high speed train, such as what they use in Japan - a bullet train like concept - as opposed to the one we have at the moment which may well have been devised in Chile where the peak hour trains are pulled by a team of Llama&#8217;s.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Elect a fascist government. While you might not necessarily agree with ALL of his philosophies, getting the trains to run on time is certainly a feather in Mussolini&#8217;s cap.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>In conclusion, you must do the right thing. Learn a lesson from Tsar NicholasII - In the early 20th century he ignored the needs of the peasantry in order to protect his own imperial needs and requirements, and the end result was revolution!</p>

<p>Time would fail me to list the complaints about other public issues - health, public housing, education, tax, the existence of the Adelaide Crows, funding for the arts, Hindmarsh stadium, Port supporters (in general), the insidious spread of communism throughout the lan due to a lack of forts - so just give me an express train that is actually &#8220;express&#8221; and Ill be happy.</p>

<p>Yours Sincerely Jason Lassey</p>
<hr />
<p>And here&#8217;s my constructed-as-good-as-most-trains rant:</p>

<p>The train system is appaling. You pay $26.90 for a &#8220;Regular&#8221; multi-trip ticket to sit on a noisy train with noisier people. What warrants this cost? I don&#8217;t get a bottle of champagne when I board, nor do I get my own compartment with heated towel and complimentary mint. I would happily pay this if there were better seats. The seats have little to no padding in them. Maybe twice in my entire life have I sat on a train seat that has padding. The seats are too close together, I am always bumping knees with the person across from me and I am occasionally sharing a seat with a 300lb fat guy who&#8217;s body mass overflows his own seat and into mine. Space out the seats (about one and a half times) and attach another carriage. The train is always packed with people, spreading 2 carriages crammed with people over 3 would be a much better plan. There is not a single seat spare after Mawson Lakes, and many people who board at that station are left standing, especially when it rains.</p>

<p>Most of the trains are nearly as old as me! The track I&#8217;m sure is just about as old, and the &#8220;express&#8221; train, as Wookie implied, is not really express at all! It takes me (according to the official timetable) 36 minutes to travel 26.69 km (this is the road distance, an average speed of 44.483km/h). I never get to the train station at the scheduled &#8220;8:27&#8221; because there is this OBNOXIOUS obese woman who rides in on a scooter at Salisbury. The train has to stop, the driver has to put the planks down so she can board, the whole process taking about 2 minutes. Why don&#8217;t we have a similar system to what the new buses do, like a lift to get these people on the train?</p>

<p>In PEAK HOUR TRAFFIC, from South Terrace in Adelaide to Elizabeth Station I can drive quicker. DEMOLISH the whole train line. The only reason why I don&#8217;t drive is because it&#8217;s cheaper for me to catch the train.</p>

<p>Build a maglev train. That way I can leave at 8:10 and get to Adelaide ON TIME. They are safer. They are new. They are shiny. They don&#8217;t make as much noise. I heard a certain government has a large wad of surplus that maybe, just maybe, they could spend upgrading Adelaide&#8217;s train network.</p>

<p>The ticketing system is old and outdated. The tickets should have a little radio transmitter in them that opens the gate when a person with a valid ticket nears. This&#8217;ll stop the hold up of the old woman with Parkinsons trying to fit her ticket in the slot provided.</p>

<p>If New York is the city that never sleeps, Adelaide is in a coma.</p>

   <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>For this project at work we made a &#8220;pact&#8221; not to cut our hair or trim our beards until the project end, unknown at this point, assuming by the end of my contract (4th Dec, my birthday). So I thought. The other day the boss, Adam, walks in with a shorter haircut than the day previous. I make an objection and he says it was never part of &#8220;the rules&#8221; and everyone else agrees with him. So I decided I would get my hair cut.</p>

<p>The last time I had my hair cut was around the time Shrek 3 was just coming out (late May, I think). So it&#8217;s been a while. I let it get this far:</p>

   <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I was walking through town at a pace I feel comfortable at (faster than most) to go to Adrenalin down Hindley Street to get my friends&#8217; Valhalla tickets.</p>

<p>Getting there was fine.</p>

<p>Getting back was not.</p>

<p>Shortly after leaving Adrenalin, four women come out from a building. Two of them are on the too-many-whoppers side of things and the other two are quite nice looking. Shame they were all lighting up cigarettes. I cannot stand the smell of cigarette smoke. To add to this, they had all started chatting nonchalantly to each other at near-light speed and slowed their walking pace to that of a turtle running uphill. They had also spread out shoulder-to-shoulder across the path, preventing anyone (including myself) from passing.</p>

<p>I would&#8217;ve said &#8220;excuse me&#8221;, but&#8230; well I&#8217;m sure you know how hard it is to get a word in between a conversation between two women. I thought my chances were pretty slim trying to get a syllable in between the four of them.</p>

<p>I waited for the traffic to clear on both sides of the road and crossed, unhindered and at my quick pace. It was wonderful. Three guys suddenly step out, DIRECTLY IN FRONT OF ME, cutting me off and &#8220;assume the position&#8221;, shoulder-to-shoulder across the damn path. I tried to pass them but there was a constant flow of &#8220;oncoming (pedestrian) traffic&#8221; and they were walking almost as slow as the women!</p>

<p>Read this people of Adelaide: If I find you walking slowly through my town and I have somewhere to be. MOVE. Simply put, move to one side. A good rule of thumb is to stay left. Don&#8217;t zig-zag along the pathway because that is exactly what I&#8217;m doing behind you to try and get past. Also for the weight conscious amongst you, how about walking a little faster?</p>
<hr />
<p>There&#8217;s this little Italian kid on the train, probably aged about 13-14. You know the type. Short hair, and a voice that breaks whenever he speaks. When he does speak (which is almost as constantly as the girls in the story before), his voice cracks. At Islington he puts one foot on the handle of the door of the train and pushes the door open and sticks his head out and yells to his mates. Whilst the train is still moving. His mates board the train (after it has stopped) and they talk as constantly and loudly as he does, each trying to better the other one&#8217;s story. I am so tempted that when the train is still moving and this kid has his head out the window just to quietly fold my laptop lid down, get out of my seat and gently push him out the door. If only there weren&#8217;t laws against that kind of thing.</p>}]]></content>

   <content type="html"><![CDATA[<ol>
<li>The good guy always needs to constantly display a &#8220;tough guy&#8221; image. If it&#8217;s a good girl, then she must either be dressed in tight latex and must not weigh more than 60 kilos.</li>

<li>Following on from #1, the bad guy must always have a girlfriend who must always know Kung-Fu. Halfway through the movie kill off the girl in the most elaborately, totally-impossible way. This gives the bad guy something to cry about.</li>

<li>At least one of the good guy&#8217;s family members. Said family member will get kidnapped and held hostage, giving the good guy something to seek vengeance over.</li>

<li>If any police feature and have speaking lines, they must act like they are ex-military, shouting their orders and catch-phrases like &#8220;LET&#8217;S GO, PEOPLE!&#8221; and suffixing 93% of all sentences with &#8220;NOW!&#8221;</li>

<li>The good guy&#8217;s gun is 94% accurate and when it is used, will kill most henchmen in one shot no matter where they are shot.</li>

<li>Henchmens&#8217; guns on the other hand, continuously miss. If henchmen fires 189 bullets at good guy from 10 feet away, and the good guy is protected only by an object such as a couch, all bullets will miss. This includes if good guy is getting shot at by fighter jet. All missiles launched from afore-mentioned aircraft will miss, and if aircraft fires its machine guns, all 10,000 bullets will miss.</li>

<li>Ridiculous amounts of explosions. If it can explode, it will explode.</li>

<li>Computers making electronic noises, even though they don&#8217;t really do that in real life.</li>

<li>1 Computers with large amounts of garbled text scrolling so it actually looks like the computer is doing something. Without this the audience will think your computers are inferior!</li>

<li>2 Computers able to find other computers and display an IP address and a name of who that IP address belongs to.</li>

<li>Comic relief that says something corny every 10.78 minutes.</li>

<li>Vehicles moving at high speeds and performing insane stunts. If good guy is driving, at least one of the vehicles must crash into something airborne, resulting in a massive explosion.</li>

<li>Good guy must get battered, bruised and cut. Then good guy is able to perform ridiculous stunts, such as jumping on aircraft.</li>

<li>A building or structure must be destroyed. Whole building or structure must also explode like it was built with TNT &amp; C4. No exceptions.</li>

<li>Use of complex terms like &#8220;isolate him with a level four firewall around his router&#8217;s flux capacitor!&#8221;</li>

<li>Police will arrive the nanosecond the bad guy dies. Must be at least three whole precincts worth. Must arrive in every form of transportation available.</li>

<li>Any shots of helicopters, the helicopter must be leaning heavily to one side, turning away from the camera. Must also have one man hanging out one side holding an automatic rifle.</li>
</ol>

   <title>InLAN August Event</title>
   <link href="http://ryanbigg.com/2007/08/inlan-august-event"/>
   <updated>2007-08-11T00:00:00+10:00</updated>
   <id>http://ryanbigg.com/2007/08/inlan-august-event</id>
   <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>On Saturday, 11th August yet another <span>url=&#8217;http://www.inlan.net.au&#8217;</span>InLAN<span>/url</span> event was held. At first I was reluctant to go, remembering last time that I went there was very little organisation in the event, and no competitions were run at all. I am happy to report that this time there was a much higher-level of organisation, and I can almost go as far as saying that is the best organisation I have seen. Competitions were run on time thanks to a well thought out timetable.</p>

<p>I left home at 8:30 (even though the event started at 10) because I had to collect drinks for myself and the two people I was bringing to the event, Nich (narthollis) and James (Devastator). Arriving at James&#8217; house and loading up the car I realised I had forgotten my monitor. We drove back to my house, arriving there at 9:45, collected my monitor and left. As an apology for making James and Nich late to InLAN, I shouted them McDonalds for lunch. $24.95, 9 hash browns, 2 Bacon &amp; Egg Muffins and 3 chocolate thickshakes later, we headed off to InLAN.</p>

<p>Arriving at the event we saw many people had already set up and some were still setting up, and there was a table near the door spare which Nich and I claimed. Setting up was easy as it&#8217;s just a routine I go through every event. Played a few games of Counter-Strike:Source GunGame and F.E.A.R. Combat with people from the event before the first competition began.</p>

<p>The first competition was Counter-Strike:Source GunGame. People had plenty of time to warmup in the practice server (thanks to Diesel for hosting it). The first gun in GunGame is the AWP, which is a powerful sniper rifle which kills in one shot. Thanks to the 5 seconds of freeze time, players were able to line up headshots on the opposing team and the millisecond the freeze time ended there was this tremendous boom of AWP firing. I managed to shoot someone, and therefore level up to the M249. Rushing to the other spawn point and killing whatever got in my way levelled me up to level 8. From there it was just rushing and killing whatever I could. A few other players reached the grenade level (23) before I did, and then I managed to catch up. Throwing a grenade into the T-Spawn resulted in someone dying. Little did I realise that my grenade had actually killed another player, and I was disappointed to hear someone was on the knife level. When I died I realised that player was me. Rushing the front lines again I ran up to someone and in one stab killed the player to take out the competition. For that I won a 320GB harddrive valued at $99.</p>

<p>At lunch time a sausage sizzle with copious amounts of sausages was provided. The lanners lined up in an as much of an orderly &#8220;line&#8221; as lanners do, and collected their free sausages. Also with the free sausages came free bread, free tomato sauce and free mustard. Compliments to the chefs. Dave, one of the admins of the event, had Gastro and left between the sausage sizzle and the second competition to rest at home. Even with one admin gone, the organisation was still at a high standard.</p>

<p>The second competition was an old-school Quake 1 1v1 Single-Elimination Deathmatch which was &#8220;won&#8221; (read: owned) by <span>url=img/valhalla/devastator.jpg</span>Devastator (file photo)<span>/url</span>. For his efforts he won a Logitech G5 Gaming Mouse.</p>

<p>The third competition was F.E.A.R. Combat, which there was a rather lengthy practice thanks to Night_Shade&#8217;s computer &#8220;not co-operating&#8221; and in which Devastator took a healthy lead of 80 something points. Night_Shade eventually joined the game, only to be plagued by more computer troubles. Devastator again took the lead and also took out this competition to win a Sennheiser PC130 headset which he promptly gave away to a random at the LAN FOR FREE. Second prize (1GB Flash Disk) was awarded to Spike after a second round, and I claimed third prize (two chocolate bars).</p>

<p>The final competition was TrackMania: Nations which was won by Insane Gazebo who managed to somehow go around the course in just under a minute. Second prize went to Devastator and third went to a random.</p>

<p>Throughout the day coffee runs were performed and for dinner the traditional pizza was devoured. Entry to the event was only $20 and that included pizza.</p>

   <title>The Mystery of The Wardrobes</title>

   <id>http://ryanbigg.com/2007/08/the-mystery-of-the-wardrobes</id>
   <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Excuse the <span>url=/img/other/wardrobes.jpg</span>very nasty lens flare<span>/url</span>, but two wardrobes popped up either side of our front door this morning. I don&#8217;t know where they came from, why they are there and who dropped them off. One can assume that whoever did drop them off had no need for it and, judging by <span>url=/img/other/stickers.jpg</span>the stickers on the inside of one of the doors<span>/url</span> the person who delivered them, or a relative of theirs, aspired to be in the air force.</p>

<p>Other than that there is nothing really remarkable about them. One of them has a <span>url=/img/other/mirror.jpg</span>&#8220;full-length&#8221; mirror<span>/url</span> with a small crack in the top left on the inside of the left door, and on the top shelf it has <span>url=/img/other/hooks.jpg</span>hooks to hang something small (approx 30cm to shelf)<span>/url</span>. Each door has a lock (as seen in the mirror photo), and there <span>url=/img/other/keys.jpg</span>were four keys on the door step/urlhree are pictured, we used one to see if there was anything inside).</p>

<p>What&#8217;s really strange is, two weeks ago I moved into mum&#8217;s house and I don&#8217;t have a wardrobe, so I&#8217;ve kept my clothes in plastic tubs and work clothes on a make-shift clothes rack. Mum was talking about buying a wardrobe for me, and I don&#8217;t know if she is going to now that these have rocked up.</p>

<p>Who put them there? Come on, fess up.</p>}]]></content>

   <title>Traffic Light &#038; Train myths</title>
   <link href="http://ryanbigg.com/2007/07/traffic-light-train-myths-2"/>
   <updated>2007-07-31T00:00:00+10:00</updated>
   <id>http://ryanbigg.com/2007/07/traffic-light-train-myths-2</id>
   <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Here&#8217;s some common false myths about traffic lights that people seem to live by:</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>The traffic lights will never change again. You do not need to run when the little man is still green or flashing. If the traffic light for the traffic going your direction has changed orange, and you&#8217;re still in the middle of the crossing, do not dawdle. You will get beeped at. If you are 100m away and the light has just changed, do not run. Not only do you look like a complete idiot when you do, even if you walked you could&#8217;ve still made the lights. If you do not make it by the time the light has gone red and the traffic going your direction&#8217;s light has gone orange, do not attempt to cross. You will again get beeped at. Wait patiently on the corner, press the button, and wait until the light once again goes green. I promise you it will.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Pressing the button a billion times makes the lights change quicker. When you press the button the first time to cross the road, this inserts a small statement into the traffic light&#8217;s programmed loop that basically is &#8220;turn the light green and make the things make the noise&#8221;. Further subsequent button pushes do not magically make the traffic lights some how speedier.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Along with that, slamming the traffic light button does not make it change faster. It is not a strength contest. You will not win a prize if you slam it so hard the clink can be heard on the opposite corner.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>And here&#8217;s some they have about trains:</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>There are no more trains for the rest of the day. People will run at 5:53 to get on the 5:53 train. I see it happen every day. The train LEAVES at 5:53. If you are still running at 5:53 to get on the 5:53, you are wasting your energy. There&#8217;s another train, 12 minutes after it. I&#8217;m sure waiting for it won&#8217;t kill you.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Train seats are luggage storage. Every day I see someone put their bags on the seat next to them . The train inevitably gets full and people are left standing up whilst these people have their little bags on the seats people could be on. Here&#8217;s something you might not have thought of. Take the bag off the seat, and put it on your lap. Hey presto, a free seat and your stuff&#8217;s still safe! Or even, put it on the floor if there is no one across from you.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Everyone else doesn&#8217;t mind listening to what shops you looked at. When having mobile phone conversations, it is not necessary to dictate your entire 45-minute conversation in the loudest voice possible. Mobile phone technology has come a long way, and so you, believe it or not, are able to speak as if the person is right next to you, in a low-civilized manner. If I wanted to know what shops you looked at, I would approach you and ask you. I honestly don&#8217;t care that you visited JeansWest.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>That is all.</p>}]]></content>

<p>I won the competition for Quake 3 Corkscrew and received the gift basket which contained:</p>

   <title>Traveling Salesman</title>
   <link href="http://ryanbigg.com/2007/07/traveling-salesman"/>
   <updated>2007-07-20T00:00:00+10:00</updated>
   <id>http://ryanbigg.com/2007/07/traveling-salesman</id>
   <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>At work we have been discussing the Traveling Salesman Problem. This is classified as &#8220;NP-Hard&#8221;, according to the Wikipedia article for it, and there&#8217;s a few good reasons why. First of all, I&#8217;ll explain what it is.</p>

<p>We have a traveling salesman, let&#8217;s call him Bob. Bob starts in Adelaide and can go to one of many destinations around the world, and for each destination there are many routes. Say Bob has 10 destinations to choose from (he&#8217;s a very exclusive salesman) now each of these 10 destinations link to the other 9 destinations, creating 90 links in total. Bob starts at destination #1 (Adelaide) and can travel to any of the other 9 points. The problem with this is: we cannot read Bob&#8217;s mind. We don&#8217;t know if Bob wants to go from Adelaide to Perth (and in some cases he will need to go to Sydney first&#8230; I&#8217;ll explain later), Adelaide to Los Angeles, Adelaide to New York, you get the idea.</p>

<p>Now expand the number of points to around 100. That&#8217;s 100 x 99 routes, or 9,900 routes. That may not seem a lot but you see that the problem is getting exponentially out of hand.</p>

<p>Now imagine that Bob is not a person, but a packet in your computer. Bob can go to many different websites, like Google, Youtube or this site. Bob must pass through many routers (points) before he reaches his final point. To do this, Bob first goes to the home router, the home router connects one of the Internet Service Provider&#8217;s routers. This pattern continues until the link is established to the final point.</p>

<p>We know what the start destination is, and we know what the end destination is and we pass that information on to the router. The router then looks in it&#8217;s routing table and finds one of the many routes that lead to that final point, and pass it on to the next router. Each router knows of it&#8217;s neighbours and nothing more.</p>

<p>Point 1 knows that it can get to point 3 through 2, 2 knows that it can get to 4 through 3, and 3 knows that it can get directly to 4. It&#8217;s a beautiful part-solution to the Traveling Salesman Problem.</p>

<ul>
<li>About the Adelaide to Perth through Sydney. For those of you who don&#8217;t live in Australia I&#8217;ll first explain that Adelaide is in the bottom-middle of Australia, Perth is on the West coast and Sydney on the East coast. Sometimes when flying to Perth you need to catch a flight to Sydney and then to Perth, which is incredibly stupid. What happened to direct flights?</li>

   <title>When Duplication May Seem Necessary</title>
   <link href="http://ryanbigg.com/2007/07/when-duplication-may-seem-necessary"/>
   <updated>2007-07-11T00:00:00+10:00</updated>
   <id>http://ryanbigg.com/2007/07/when-duplication-may-seem-necessary</id>
   <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>At work we&#8217;re making a management system for Ferries, Accommodation, Rental Cars, Coach Tours and some other things. I&#8217;ve been assigned to work on the bookings section, which has proven to be quite difficult.</p>

<p>We have a table called Services, which keeps track of bookable items for the various items. The bookings table is linked to passengers and vehicles via has_many associations, and whenever we create a new booking we need to assign brand new passengers every time, so say if I travelled to Kangaroo Island every week, they would enter my name 52 times in a year. I know, not everyone travels 52 times a year, but over time this builds up.</p>

<p>Eventually the passengers table is going to have duplications where it seems that it is necessary because there is no way to uniquely identify one &#8220;John Smith&#8221; from another &#8220;John Smith&#8221; other than extra redundant data like an address field. Then what if there&#8217;s two John Smiths (Father &amp; Son) living at the same address, how do we know which one is which? This is why we need duplication in our table, we simply have no convenient way of being able to choose which passenger is which. The system will eventually also need a way to keep track of &#8220;frequent flyers&#8221;, people who travel frequently, and I don&#8217;t know how they&#8217;re going to implement that.</p>

<p>It didn&#8217;t feel right. It still doesn&#8217;t feel right. There&#8217;s an easier way, unfortunately I don&#8217;t know of it. Maybe some of my readers might know.</p>
<hr />
<p>I&#8217;ve also booked out <em>another</em> weekend. If anyone&#8217;s planning on inviting me out to anything (hahaha, I should become a comedian), don&#8217;t.</p>

<p>Friday night I&#8217;m apparently going &#8220;out&#8221; (read: across to the boardroom) to have drinks with Marketing.</p>

<p>Saturday Morning I am moving to my Mum&#8217;s house. It&#8217;ll be unusual to see this room semi-empty.</p>

<p>Saturday Afternoon-Night I&#8217;m going out to 24-hour motorbike thing where it&#8217;s a huge 250km cross-country course motorbikes ride aorund and every six hours they pass nearby. It&#8217;s interesting to see how much they know about their bike when they&#8217;re in the pits. They know that if it&#8217;s making a certain noise that a spoke may be loose. The only shame is that you sleep in six hour blocks. Last time I slept on a &#8220;slight&#8221; slope, and kept sliding to the other end of my tent. This time I hope to find flat ground.</p>

<p>Sunday afternoon, my time to relax.</p>

<p>Every weekend I go &#8220;I have nothing planned for next weekend&#8221; and usually by Wednesday it&#8217;s all booked out. Eventually I&#8217;ll find one.</p>}]]></content>

   <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I received my new laptop last night and after exorcising Vista successfully I am now happily running Ubuntu with a few minor issues. When I right click on the time and click the Adjust button, it presents me with the password dialog box for &#8220;time-admin&#8221;, I enter my password and nothing happens. Obviously this program is not installed, and I have tried apt-get install time-admin and it&#8217;s not in there, but apart from that everything&#8217;s smooth.</p>

<p>I received my new motherboard today, an Abit F-I90HD, minus the RAM that needs to go in it to get working. So now I have a motherboard inside my shuttle case with an awesome CPU (E6600) and graphics card (8800GTS), but no RAM. Tomorrow&#8217;s a RAM shopping day.</p>

<p>I also have a motherboard not in any case, with CPU, RAM, on-board graphics , a spare IDE cable and a case to put it in, so tomorrow I&#8217;m going to put the components in a spare case.</p>

<p>As for my old computer (which really isn&#8217;t that old), I&#8217;m selling the parts. There&#8217;s a motherboard (Gigabite GA-K8NS-Pro) with an AMD Sempron 3100+, one DDR2 333 stick of 512mb RAM, one DD2 400 stick of 512mb RAM, an nVidia 6600GT and a Creative SB0230 Sound Card. I think my uncle John wanted the video card, but everything else is up for grabs. My brother&#8217;s offering me $50 for the motherboard with the CPU, which is ridiculous (I hope you&#8217;re reading this Scott).</p>

<p>At the moment only one of the four &#8220;computers&#8221; in my room is operational, and that&#8217;s my laptop. Tomorrow&#8217;s going to be fun. Goodbye weekend.</p>}]]></content>

   <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ve waited two weeks for my motherboard and RAM to turn up from Just Computing. The first week of waiting was due to them not ordering it, and this week has been due to the supplier making Just Computing jump through all kinds of hoops to let them order stock from them (no wonder why there were reluctant). Apparently my parts are somewhere in Adelaide. If anyone sees an Abit FI-90HD Motherboard coupled with 2x1GB Corsair 667 RAM, please notify me and I&#8217;ll come around and pick them up.</p>

<p>I ordered a laptop two days ago through my dad. It turned up today. The only problem thus far is that it automatically installs Vista as soon as you turn it on. Vista, for those of you who have been living under a rock, in a coma or under an enormous effect from some psychotropic drug, SUCKS. I need not detail the why, as you may just type &#8220;Vista&#8221; into Google and get results like this: <span>url=http://apcmag.com/5049/10_reasons_not_to_get_vista</span>10 Reasons Not to Get Vista<span>/url</span></p>

<p>In hindsight I should&#8217;ve ordered a laptop with no OS installed, and if that was not possible then I would ask for XP to be installed. On Dad&#8217;s request, I have run the Recovery Disk Creator using Vista, and after that&#8217;s done I&#8217;m going to stick in a freshly baked Ubuntu CD and exorcise Vista off the hard drive and put Ubuntu in it&#8217;s place.</p>
<hr />
<p>In other news, the guys at TravelLink Technology (including me) have decided to stop shaving until the development of the project ends. We&#8217;re going to be taking a picture every day throughout the project&#8217;s development of our faces and also the relationships between the tables. The legacy system&#8217;s relationship diagram stretches over an A3 page and the font is about size 8, so that&#8217;ll give you some idea of how many tables there are. I&#8217;m going to grab the pictures and put them up on the site as I go along, but I&#8217;ll make that page another day when I don&#8217;t have Vista to exorcise.</p>

<p>Wish me luck, see you on the other side.</p>}]]></content>

   <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Another work of fiction based on my obsessive need to tell people not to press the damn button over and over again! I suppress it usually.</p>

<p>One day on the way to work I was walking my usual route through town. I walked up to a set of traffic lights and found one of my friends pushing the button over and over again. I walked closer and said, &#8220;You know it doesn&#8217;t matter how many times you push that button, it isn&#8217;t going to change any faster. &#8220;Hi Ryan.&#8221; He replied. &#8220;Did you know the energy you put into pushing that button could be better spent increasing your cranial capacity?&#8221; &#8220;I do now&#8221;, he said, still pushing the button. &#8220;The first time someone pushes the button it inserts a single function into the cycle of the lights, basically telling the &#8220;don&#8217;t walk&#8221; sign at the other end to change to a &#8220;walk&#8221; sign if the button is pressed. You could press it a billion times, although I don&#8217;t think you&#8217;d have enough time between light changes.&#8221; The light changed, and we walked across the street. &#8220;Do you know the powers of 2 from 1 to 20? The first 20 elements? The Theory of Relativity?&#8221; &#8220;Do you know how to change a tyre?&#8221; He retorted. &#8221;I&#8217;ve done it a few times. &#8220;What about how to get a girlfriend?&#8221; &#8220;You&#8217;re one to ask.&#8221; &#8220;At least I don&#8217;t turn to mush when they talk to me.&#8221; &#8220;That&#8217;s a lie and you know it! You&#8217;re worse than me!&#8221; As we arrived at the next set of lights, my friend continued pushing the button. &#8221;I&#8217;ll wave to you at my Nobel Prize ceremony.&#8221; I said. &#8221;I&#8217;ll talk to you later.&#8221; &#8220;Asshole!&#8221; he shouted at me. &#8220;Proud of it!&#8221; I shouted back, walking into the building.</p>

   <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today I was looking for the correct syntax of &#8220;&lt;=&gt;&#8221;, I wasn&#8217;t sure if it was &lt;=&gt; or &lt;==&gt;, so I typed both of them into Google and got back a blank result, not even a &#8220;Your search - &lt;=&gt; - did not match any documents.&#8221; message.

<p>So my question to Google is: &#8220;Why aren&#8217;t you returning results for this string?&#8221;</p>

<p>If anyone is knowledgeable in this subject, please fill me in. I had the idea that I could enter anything into Google and get back unimpeded results, but this does not appear to be the case.</p>}]]></content>

   <title>Error 21 - GRUB - SOLVED!</title>
   <link href="http://ryanbigg.com/2007/06/error-grub-solved"/>
   <updated>2007-06-18T00:00:00+10:00</updated>
   <id>http://ryanbigg.com/2007/06/error-grub-solved</id>
   <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>On Friday afternoon at work I ran into an error 21 on one of the computers I had just installed Ubuntu onto. I googled what it meant and it said &#8220;device not found&#8221;. So I wracked my brain (and google) during the spare moments of my weekend because it bothers me when I get a problem that I can&#8217;t solve, and I couldn&#8217;t find a good solution where I went &#8220;That must be it!&#8221;. Also on this same computer I couldn&#8217;t get the 7.04-desktop CD to launch into X, it was scrolling the screen with -bash: /dev/null permission denied errors, which the disk did not do on any other computer that I installed it with.</p>

<p>Today at work I downloaded the absolute bare-minimum installer for Ubuntu and actually got that to boot AND install, and I was very happy about that. Then after the install I still had a big ugly grin on my face, thinking I&#8217;m top-shit and this bloody error message pops up, AGAIN! I threw the pen that I was spinning on my fingers across the desk and paced to my desk and back again.</p>

<p>Ran my hands through my hair and an abstract piece of a post I was reading on the weekends came to me. It had mentioned something about checking the cables and the drives making sure that they were set to master/slave and so on. But I wouldn&#8217;t have that issue because the only hard drive in this machine was a SATA drive, which automatically detects(?) the configuration. Then I thought I would open the box up and make sure of that, so I went to the other building, grabbed a screwdriver, opened the case up and spotted the SIX sata connectors on the motherboard. I thought if I switched the cable over to another one, say from SATA 1 to SATA 2, it&#8217;s something I haven&#8217;t tried and it might work.</p>

<p>I switched it over, left the sides off and booted, and saw the wonderful &#8220;Press ESC to go into menu&#8221; of grub.</p>

<p>And then I saw another error! Something to do with IRQ, and apparently suffixing the kernel line in the bootloader with &#8220;irqpoll&#8221; fixes it, and so I did. Ubuntu is now running awesomely on that PC.</p>

<p>So in short: Try swapping over the cable to another connector on the motherboard.</p>

<p>Also if anyone knows how to get ATi cards working in harmony with Beryl, that would be nice to know. I&#8217;ve googled it and tried the examples and it errors, something about texture failing&#8230; I&#8217;ll try writing down the message tomorrow.</p>}]]></content>

   <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m going to keep this short, it&#8217;s Sunday nearing 10:30pm and I think I&#8217;m coming down with Monday-itis.</p>

<p>This is not a bad Wizard commercial, it&#8217;s simply a suggestion.</p>

<p>PHP is already taught in schools around the country, and most likely around the world. What I don&#8217;t see is any support for Ruby on Rails in schools or TAFE colleges, which sucks. Ruby on Rails is a very easy-to-learn language and a vast majority of the commands are written in plain english. Compare:</p>

<p><span>code=&#8217;PHP&#8217;</span> mysql_query(&#8220;SELECT * FROM <code>blogs</code> WHERE <code>user_id</code> = &#8216;1&#8217; ORDER BY <code>id</code> DESC&#8221;) <span>/code</span></p>

<p>with:</p>

<p><span>code=&#8217;Ruby on Rails&#8217;</span> Blog.find_by_user_id(1, :order =&gt; &#8220;id DESC&#8221;) <span>/code</span></p>

<p>I&#8217;m sure there&#8217;s better examples out there than just that. It&#8217;s a beautiful language that students would enjoy. So why not teach it in schools and TAFE? Have a whole TAFE course devoted to Ruby and Rails. Now that would be worth it.</p>}]]></content>

   <title>Pimp My Case!</title>
   <link href="http://ryanbigg.com/2007/06/pimp-my-case"/>

   <id>http://ryanbigg.com/2007/06/pimp-my-case</id>
   <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>For those of you that don&#8217;t know, there&#8217;s a show out called &#8220;Pimp My Ride!&#8221;. On the show, people give their cars to a group of pros (Xzibit and his crew) and they pimp out the ride, adding overkill entertainment systems and generally making the rides look sweet.</p>

<p>My mum&#8217;s friend Charmaine was having computer troubles a while back, I thought I would be nice and go over there and check it out and, hopefully, fix the issue. The Computer, and I use that term very loosely, was running Windows 98. 98 was released in, you guessed it, 1998, making it nine years old.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s about 90 years in real life. It&#8217;s old. It&#8217;s fragile. It whines at everything. It&#8217;s ugly.</p>

<p>To top it off, the computer is running on 200mhz with 32mb of RAM. It has a freakin&#8217; turbo button for God&#8217;s sake! I suppose I should mention now that she&#8217;s on dial-up too.</p>

<p>Now if you look at <span>url=/img/pimpmycase/old-case-back.jpg</span>the back of the case<span>/url</span> you will notice many things:</p>

<ol>
<li>The case is U shaped, meaning the top and both sides come off in one piece.</li>

<li>It&#8217;s old and dusty.</li>

<li>There&#8217;s no PS/2 ports.</li>

<li>There&#8217;s no USB ports.</li>

<li>It has an RS232 port.</li>

<li>It has a parallel port.</li>

<li>It has a serial port.</li>

<li>It makes your eyes water.</li>
</ol>

<p>Originally I brought around my m-robe, thinking I&#8217;ll be able to put some programs on the computer and fix her problems, but without a USB port there was no chance of that happening.</p>

<p>During the first time I was there Charmaine talked about eventually upgrading the computer. She mentioned that she might consider it more after she returned from her trip to Canada.</p>

<p>She returned a few weekends ago and her husband gave me some cash for a new everything. Here&#8217;s what I got her: Motherboard: Asus AM2-940 M2N8-VMX $65 RAM: 1GB DDR2 667 5300 $45 Monitor: Viewsonic 17&#8221; VA703B 8ms $215 Power Supply: 550 Max. SHAW PSU $25 Case: CM Ammo RC-533 $89 Keyboard: Multimedia Slim Keyboard $7 Mouse: Generic Optical Mouse $7 DVD Drive: Samsung 18x Black DVD-RW $38 CPU: AM2-940 x2 Dual Core 3600+ $88 Harddrive: 80GB Maxtor $50</p>

<p>Total: $629.00 Budget: $650.00</p>

<p>I only got the CPU because they were out of the 3200s and I didn&#8217;t want to wait another week for them to order in the parts and go to the trouble of having to go down there again.</p>

<p>This is a whole system and that&#8217;s an awesome price. Now for a very-near bleeding edge kit you&#8217;d pay something like $2.5k.</p>

<p>Anyway, there&#8217;s some pics of the new case and associated other things at <span>url=/img/pimpmycase</span>Pimp My Case<span>/url</span>. Enjoy.</p>}]]></content>

   <title>When DCHP goes bad!</title>
   <link href="http://ryanbigg.com/2007/06/when-dchp-goes-bad"/>
   <updated>2007-06-14T00:00:00+10:00</updated>
   <id>http://ryanbigg.com/2007/06/when-dchp-goes-bad</id>
   <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I couldn&#8217;t find anything similar to this on Google, maybe I just wasn&#8217;t googling the right things.</p>

<p>So at work they installed some new computers recently which both have one network interface each and both are set to dhcp and both are running Ubuntu 7.04.</p>

<p>At work they have two connections to the outside world, one is a Telstra link (192.168.0.9 -&gt; 192.168.0.82 -&gt; Internet), and the other is an Internode connection (192.168.0.254).</p>

<p>The first two addresses in both sets of brackets are gateways. 192.168.0.9 is the DHCP server for the whole 192.168.0.* network, as well as the first gateway. 192.168.0.254 is a router which connects to Internode. 192.168.0.82 is another router, which the DHCP server (192.168.0.9) uses as it&#8217;s default gateway. This means that every computer that 192.168.0.9 assigns an IP address to, it will set it&#8217;s default gateway to 192.168.0.9 which forwards to 192.168.0.82, which is the wrong connection! Confused yet?</p>

<p>Shortly after realising this we noticed that if we did: <span>term</span> route del default gw 192.168.0.9 route add default gw 192.168.0.254 <span>/term</span></p>

<p>&#8230;it would set the default gateway to 192.168.0.254, the correct one! We figured that if we rebooted it would remember this setting. We were wrong. Upon rebooting it reverts back to 192.168.0.9 and we were back at square one.</p>

<p>Anuj suggested that we make an init.d script and Adam suggested using update-rc.d to get it to run on startup. So that&#8217;s what we did. (Ours was originally named &#8220;route_del&#8221;, I thought I&#8217;d give it a better name here.</p>

<p><span>code=&#8217;/etc/init.d/fix_routes&#8217;</span></p>

<h1 id='binbash'>!/bin/bash</h1>

<p>route del default gw 192.168.0.9 route add default gw 192.168.0.254 <span>/code</span></p>

<p>And then entered the command:</p>

<p><span>code</span> sudo update-rc.d fix_routes defaults <span>/code</span></p>

<p>And rebooted. Upon rebooting the computer the default route was set at 192.168.0.254 and we weren&#8217;t connected to crappy Telstra any more!</p>

<p>Edit: Adam, the guy who basically runs <span>url=http://offbeat-zero.net/pulse</span>WSI<span>/url</span>, has informed me that if I add the lines: <span>code</span> up route del gw 192.168.0.82 up route add gw 192.168.0.254 down route del gw 192.168.0.254 down route add gw 192.168.0.82 <span>/code</span> to /etc/network/interfaces just under the definition of my network interface (eth0) it will do the same thing and is much less of a hack than our solution.</p>}]]></content>

   <title>Damn Ubuntu!</title>

   <id>http://ryanbigg.com/2007/06/damn-ubuntu</id>
   <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>&#8220;Yeah, it&#8217;s a tomorrow problem.&#8221; I said yesterday in regards to installing Ubuntu on the development server at work. Little did I know that it would cause so many hassles.</p>

<p>First of all the mirror at http://au.archive.ubuntu.org didn&#8217;t have some packages, so I changed that to mirror.internode.on.net and that seemed to fix everything except for the nginx package. So I changed &#8220;dapper&#8221; to &#8220;feisty&#8221; in /etc/apt/sources.list and it found it and installed it. Then it decided to remove/alter some key features. That wasn&#8217;t good. I tried compiling imagemagick, and that failed with a &#8220;cannot compile executable&#8221; error (which there are only ~700,000 results for on Google!). Then I tried doing apt-get install build-essential. That needed libc-dev which needed lib6c-dev, which needed gcc, which needed libc-dev. See my conundrum?</p>

<p>So I hooked up the dev server to the Internode connection and pulled a cool 1mb/sec off their mirror and downloaded 7.04-server in just under 6 minutes. So I burnt that to another disk and went to install it, it got up to &#8220;Selecting and Installing Software&#8221; and hangs at 85% on update-manager-core.</p>

<p>EDIT: I have just tried installing it on my server, and it hangs at precisely the same point. I&#8217;m going to leave it on overnight and see if it progresses any further.</p>

<p>EDIT #2 (14th June 07): I was watching Medium last night and I heard the CD-drive open. I turned on my screen to see ubuntu had finished installing. Apparently it takes a while at that point. Also, you may need to do &#8220;sudo apt-get install update-manager-core&#8221;. I didn&#8217;t, thankfully, but I did see it automatically included in one of the installs I did this morning.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s a tomorrow problem.</p>

<p>They also have a weird network setup. Five of the computers in the office seem to be on a Telstra connection (around 50kb/s), which goes something like PC -&gt; another PC -&gt; another PC -&gt; Routr -&gt; Internet, and the rest of the computers in the office are on an Internode connection (around 900-1200kb/s) which goes something like PC -&gt; Router -&gt; Internet.</p>

<p>All of the computers are plugged into the same switch, yet it&#8217;s connecting to a different network. Maybe I&#8217;ll have to have a play around with the route settings tomorrow.</p>}]]></content>

   <id>http://ryanbigg.com/2007/06/you-smell</id>
   <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I was on the train last night coming from Adelaide to my station and around Nurlutta (about 6 stops away from station) this Aboriginal guy gets on. Instantly this smell infiltrates my nostrils and I fight back the urge to show the guy what I ate for lunch. The worst part is he sat across from me. He mumbled a few things and I completely ignored him.</p>

<p>BUT THIS SMELL WAS UNHOLY. Score +1 for proof there isn&#8217;t a God. Think of everything bad you&#8217;ve ever smelt and concentrate it on one person. I am not over-exaggerating. This is what he smelt like, everything unholy and more.</p>

<p>So I moved one seat up so I could be closer to the door and get the fresh air faster than anyone else in the train. I tried to slow my breathing, holding my breath and so on, but it kept coming back. When the door would open I would subtly lean towards the door and take long deep breaths of the lovely fresh air.</p>

<p>The worst part is that when I got off the train, I could still smell it faintly on my jumper.</p>

<p>It should be a criminal offense, classified under the bio-weapon law umbrella, it was DEVASTATING. I can not stress that enough.</p>

<p>How can people even get to that stage? How can people even let other people get to that stage? Wouldn&#8217;t they notice <em>something</em>?</p>
<hr />
<p>I know this is getting too much of a habit, putting two blogs in one post, but what are you going to do about it?</p>

<p>I ordered some computer parts for my computer and a friend&#8217;s computer, from <span>url=http://msy.com.au</span>a certain computer store<span>/url</span>. WARNING WEBSITE MAY DESTROY ALL HOPE. It was a clear list of what I wanted, and I assumed they would just email me back and tell me when they were ready to be picked up. No such event occurred, so I phoned them up yesterday and was told that they don&#8217;t hold parts for people for more than 2 days. They could&#8217;ve at least told me that in an email, but no response. This is poor customer service, and I&#8217;m considering taking my money (a lot of it) somewhere else.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s what I ordered:</p>

<p>Friend&#8217;s Computer Motherboard: Asus M2N8 CPU: AN2 Sempron 3000+ RAM: 1gb-667 Generic Monitor: 17&#8221; Viewsonic VA703B-8ms Power Supply: SHAW 550W Case: Coolermaster Ammo RC533 Keyboard: Slim Black-Sliver Keyboard Mouse: USB Optical</p>

<p>Parts for mine: CPU: Intel Core 2 Duo E6600 Graphics Card: 640MB 8800GTS Leadtek</p>

<p>That&#8217;s about $1,000 right there. So now I have to re-order all that crap in, I might stop by their store today and verbally order it.</p>}]]></content>

   <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A few months ago monopoly.com.au had this voting thing, which allowed anyone and everyone to vote for what should be on the Australian version of the Monopoly game, the more votes the more prestigious the location would be on the board, i.e. The place with the most votes gets Mayfair.</p>

<p>So mr_wizard from <span>url=http://www.valhalla.net.au/forum</span>the Valhalla Forums<span>/url</span> devised a program that voted FOR you over and over again, and voted for Barossa and Adelaide.</p>

<p>So now Barossa and Adelaide have got more votes than NSW, ACT, VIC and QLD combined to take out Mayfair and Park Lane on the new board.</p>

<p>Well done to all parties involved.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s a few links: <span>url=http://www.news.com.au/adelaidenow/story/0,22606,21862445-5006301,00.html</span>news.com.au story<span>/url</span> <span>url=http://talbs83.razza.org/hack.jpg</span>news paper column scan<span>/url</span> <span>url=http://talbs83.razza.org/hack2.jpg</span>newspaper article scan (with picture)<span>/url</span> <span>url=http://img504.imageshack.us/my.php?image=monopolygl1.jpg</span>Colour Image<span>/url</span></p>

<p>Update 9th June 2007: The threads have been removed from the Valhalla forums due to legal advice from Valhalla&#8217;s lawyer. Personally, I don&#8217;t understand anyone who would want to raise a lawsuit against these people who had only good intentions. Any other state could&#8217;ve made the &#8220;program&#8221;, but they didn&#8217;t. We had the initiative and the intelligence to create it, and in the end of the day, that&#8217;s what always wins.</p>

<p>Again, congratulations to the Valhalla members (NOT THE COMMITTEE) who had the initiative to propel our state into pole position.</p>}]]></content>

   <title>Testing and Migrations</title>
   <link href="http://ryanbigg.com/2007/06/testing-and-migrations"/>
   <updated>2007-06-06T00:00:00+10:00</updated>
   <id>http://ryanbigg.com/2007/06/testing-and-migrations</id>
   <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>So I begun a new, very awesome job on Monday. I would say the job trumps anything Coles has to offer and here&#8217;s some of the reasons:</p>

<ol>
<li>Chairs (something that Coles really needs), comfortable ones too</li>

<li>Wide-screens</li>

<li>Lack of green bags</li>

<li>Great people with equally great knowledge about everything Rails and of course,</li>

<li>Doing something I truly love</li>
</ol>

<p><span>font:size=4</span>Testing<span>/font</span> Before starting the new job, I had some knowledge of Ruby and Rails, but since then I think it&#8217;s expanded a bit. For example, I now know how to test. Say I want to make sure that it returns an error if the blog&#8217;s subject is blank, and assuming I&#8217;ve set up the model correctly.</p>

<p><span>code</span> require File.dirname(__FILE__) + &#8216;/../test_helper&#8217; class BlogTest &lt; Test::Unit::TestCase def test_validation assert !Blog.new(:description =&gt; &#8220;Here&#8217;s a description&#8221;, :text =&gt; &#8220;And here&#8217;s some text, but uh oh&#8230;&#8221;).save end end <span>/code</span> Basically it says make sure that when I create a new blog using the fields and data provided that it errors. If it errors then it will pass the test. Testing is much more complex than that, especially when you get to the controller testing.</p>

<p>In this example we assume there&#8217;s already two blogs in the table, which is default for fixtures. We also assume that the blog controller&#8217;s action &#8220;create&#8221; is protected by the acts_as_authenticated method of logged_in, which requires session<span>:user</span> to be something other than false!</p>

<p><span>code</span> require File.dirname(__FILE__) + &#8216;/../test_helper&#8217;</p>

<h1 id='beleive_it_or_not_this_line_actually_includes_the_blog_controller_appcontrollersblog_controllerrb'>beleive it or not, this line actually includes the blog controller (app/controllers/blog_controller.rb)!</h1>

<p>require &#8216;blog_controller&#8217;</p>

<p>class BlogController; def rescue_action(e) raise e end; end</p>

<p>class BlogControllerTest &lt; Test::Unit::TestCase def setup @controller = ForumController.new @request = ActionController::TestRequest.new @response = ActionController::TestResponse.new end fixtures :blogs, :users def test_posting</p>

<h1 id='posts_to_blogcreate_and_specifies_sessionuser__1'>posts to blog/create and specifies session<span>:user</span> = 1</h1>

<p>post :create, { :blog =&gt; { :subject =&gt; &#8220;Alright, this should work.&#8221;, :description =&gt; &#8220;At least, we hope so.&#8221;, :text =&gt; &#8220;And we need text, don&#8217;t forget text.&#8221; }}, { :user =&gt; 1 } assert_equal 3, Blog.count end end <span>/code</span></p>

<p>Again, that code should pass and everything should be OK. These can be so much more complicated, I&#8217;m just using basic examples to show why they are awesome.</p>

<p>Another feature of testing is the mocks, located in &#8220;yourapp/test/mocks&#8221; these allow you to create duplicates of the libraries that you would otherwise use in the application, but may want some of the methods to perform differently than what they do in the real version. For example today I used the following:</p>

<p><span>code</span> module AuthenticatedSystem def logged_in? return true end end <span>/code</span></p>

<p>So when the test runs it loads the mocked version of AuthenticatedSystem, and when the &#8220;logged_in?&#8221; method is called it uses the method defined in the mocked version instead of the one in the real version.</p>

<p><span>font:size=4</span>Migrations<span>/font</span></p>

<p>Another thing we covered was Migrations. Migrations let you keep track of the versions of your database, and therefore allow you to revert changes if you manage, and apparently you will manage, to stuff something up.</p>

<p>To generate a migration first of all you can run the &#8220;ruby script/generate migration <pre class='markdown-html-error' style='border: solid 3px red; background-color: pink'>REXML could not parse this XML/HTML: 
&lt;name&gt;&quot;, where &lt;name&gt; is something logical, like create_tables. This will generate the first migration, or first version of your database. This file will be located at &quot;db/migrate/001_&lt;name&gt;.rb&quot;, go on and open it up to see something like this:</pre></p>

<p><span>code</span> class CreateTables &lt; ActiveRecord::Migration def self.up end def self.down end end <span>/code</span></p>

<p>Which we can flesh out to be something more like this:</p>

<p><span>code</span> class CreateTables &lt; ActiveRecord::Migration def self.up create_table :blogs do |t| add_column &#8220;subject&#8221;, :string add_column &#8220;description&#8221;, :string add_column &#8220;text&#8221;, :text add_column &#8220;created_at&#8221;, :datetime end create_table :comments do |t| add_column &#8220;text&#8221;, :text add_column &#8220;user_id&#8221;, :integer add_column &#8220;created_at&#8221;, :datetime end create_table :users do |t| add_column &#8220;login&#8221;, :string add_column &#8220;password&#8221;, :string end end</p>

<p>def self.down drop_table :blogs drop_table :comments drop_table :users end end</p>

<p><span>/code</span></p>

<p>Alright, so I elaborated a bit that time. Basically, that should create a very skeletised version of a blog + comments + users database for a blog application. So, how do we get it into the database? Well, you could go into mysql and type something like&#8230;</p>

<p>CREATE TABLE <code>blogs</code> ( <code>id</code> INT(11)&#8230; etc. etc etc. )</p>

<p>Or you could just go into your terminal/prompt and type the beautiful command of: <span>code</span> rake db:migrate <span>/code</span></p>

<p>In a hassle-free instant your tables are in your database raring to go.</p>

<p>Now say that I forgot to put in the blog_id field for comments (which I intentionally did in the example), you need to create a new migration by performing &#8220;ruby script/generate migration <pre class='markdown-html-error' style='border: solid 3px red; background-color: pink'>REXML could not parse this XML/HTML: 
&lt;another_name&gt;&quot; where another_name can be whatever you please.</pre></p>

<p>Again you&#8217;ll see the familiar self.up and self.down methods if you open 002_<pre class='markdown-html-error' style='border: solid 3px red; background-color: pink'>REXML could not parse this XML/HTML: 
&lt;another_name&gt;.rb which we&apos;ll alter to make it become:</pre></p>

<p><span>code</span> class add_blogid &lt; ActiveRecord::Migration def self.up add_column(&#8220;comments&#8221;,&#8221;blog_id&#8221;,:integer) end end</p>

<p>def self.down remove_column(&#8220;comments&#8221;,&#8221;blog_id&#8221;,:integer) end end <span>/code</span></p>

<p>After that we run &#8220;rake db:migrate&#8221; again in the terminal/prompt and we&#8217;re now up to version 2 of our database. How do we know that? Look in db/schema.rb,</p>

<p><span>code</span> ActiveRecord::Schema.define(:version =&gt; 2) <span>/code</span></p>

<p>Now what if you stuff something up?</p>

<p>rake db:migrate VERSION=<pre class='markdown-html-error' style='border: solid 3px red; background-color: pink'>REXML could not parse this XML/HTML: 
&lt;version_number_you_want_to_revert_to&gt;</pre></p>

<p>So say you want version 2 because you obliterated the users table in version 3,</p>

<p>rake db:migrate VERSION=2</p>

<p>I would like to thank Anuj and Vishal for being exceptionally patient with me thus far.</p>
<hr />
<p>Aside:</p>

<p>A few years ago I did work experience at this place called &#8220;Berlin Wall Software Supermarket&#8221;, and on my first day the owner (Rob) says to me &#8220;You shouldn&#8217;t be here.&#8221;, first impressions weren&#8217;t all that excellent. He emphasised his jerk-ness by making me and my work experience buddy go through the whole store and make sure the stock was in alphabetical order. Then we were seperated because we were getting on too well. So I went to the other store.</p>

<p>There I worked with the owner&#8217;s son, Jamie. First impressions were that he was a pretty decent person, but as soon as we got to the store it turned out he too was an asshole.</p>

<p>Now that I&#8217;ve got a new job I get to walk past both stores every day. The one closer to my work has faded displays of World of Warcraft and is always empty when I walk past it. The other store is now closed down and has been converted into a clothing store.</p>

<p>I make it my duty to walk past that store every day and silently laugh at them and think of how far I have come since those days.</p>}]]></content>

   <title>Blazin' Guns</title>
   <link href="http://ryanbigg.com/2007/06/blazin-guns"/>
   <updated>2007-06-02T00:00:00+10:00</updated>
   <id>http://ryanbigg.com/2007/06/blazin-guns</id>
   <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today I went shooting at the Marksman Security Training &amp; Indoor Range on Franklin Street in the city with Tom, his dad, his uncle and his dad&#8217;s friend.</p>

<p>It was $60 each for the five of us and we got to fire:</p>

<p>30x 9mm Glock semi-auto 10x 45ACP Glock semi-auto 12x .357 Magnum revolver 6x .44 Magnum revolver</p>

<p>Firstly we watched a training video on how to use the guns and what safety precautions to follow, stuff like don&#8217;t point the gun at other people, always aim it down range and how to reload it.</p>

<p>Then we went into the &#8220;Range A&#8221; area, where we went through again the precautions and how to load and fire the two Glocks. I was much more accurate with the 9mm Glock due to the lower recoil on it, the 45ACP was a larger gun with more of a recoil, and it shot more to the left of where I thought I was aiming it.</p>

<p>After Range A, we moved into Range B where we fired the Magnums. We were pre-warned that we may experience &#8220;a slightly more powerful recoil&#8221; and I was surprised at exactly how much recoil these things had. The .357 wasn&#8217;t too bad, but the reload time wasn&#8217;t ideal, I guess someone who uses this gun in a real life situation would be more proficient at reloading than what I was. The .44 was nuts! You load up this massive revolver with 6 shots and you expect a similar recoil to the .357 but it&#8217;s nearly twice as much, it jars the whole arm, then you have another 5 shots to go.</p>

<p>9mm results: <span>img</span>/img/other/shooting/9mm.jpg<span>/img</span></p>

<p>45ACP results: <span>img</span>/img/other/shooting/45acp.jpg<span>/img</span></p>

<p>.357 results: <span>img</span>/img/other/shooting/357magnum.jpg<span>/img</span></p>

<p>.44 results: <span>img</span>/img/other/shooting/44magnum.jpg<span>/img</span></p>

<p>And I collected two shells from the magnums</p>

<p><span>img</span>/img/other/shooting/44shell.jpg<span>/img</span> <span>img</span>/img/other/shooting/357shell.jpg<span>/img</span></p>

<p>Was a wonderful time and I would suggest it to anyone who wants a way to rid themselves very quickly of $60.</p>}]]></content>

   <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The Friday just gone (well, 4 days ago), was my last day working at Coles. A customer with her kid came through my register, and the kid was coughing up BOTH lungs and sounding not all that good about it.</p>

<p>I joked about it, &#8220;Wouldn&#8217;t it be funny if I got sick on my last day?&#8221;</p>

<p>It happened. I now have a cold which I think I&#8217;m smack-bang in the middle of. It&#8217;s wrapped itself around my vocal chords and my voice cracks whenever I try to speak, even saying something simple like &#8220;Bye&#8221; comes out all distorted.</p>

<p>I hope that this thing goes away before Monday. Wouldn&#8217;t that be horrible? Turning up to a new job and being sick on the first day.</p>

   <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Valhalla is a non-profit LAN party ran by a group of volunteers every 6-8 weeks at the St. Clair&#8217;s Recreation Centre in Woodville. This LAN party was slightly different due to the fact it was held on Court four instead of the main three courts in the Recreation Centre. This meant that the LAN had only a capacity of 180 people, but had a very nice atmosphere.</p>

<p>At the May Event, competitions ranged from Call of Duty 2 (5v5) to CounterStrike:Source, both on the PC, to Tekken 5 on the PS3, (pictured below). <span>img</span>/img/other/valhalla/tv.jpg<span>/img</span></p>

<p>One of these competitions was the Adrenalin Challenge. The Adrenalin Challenge is a challenge held by sponsors of the event and it can be for any game on any map. This event, it was for Medal of Honor:Allied Assault. The Adrenalin team chose the Nazi side and their job was to defend the cannons on top of the bunkers from the Allies, the lanners, who&#8217;s job it was to destroy those cannons. It was tough, and lots of people complained (even me a few hundred times) and rage-quitted, but it was eventually won by Hell Rok, <span>s</span>a cheating scumbag<span>/s</span>, a very lucky person who picked himself up a new 8600GT.</p>

<p>All in all, good times were had, and I&#8217;m looking forward to the next event.</p>

<p>Also, RadarLAN is on the Queen&#8217;s Birthday weekend (whenever that is), it&#8217;s on a Friday or Saturday night, and more details will be put up once Coles actually answers their damn phones.</p>}]]></content>

   <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Sometimes I don&#8217;t know why I do it. I turn on my computer before going off to do other things. Then when I inevitably return, there&#8217;s a few messages of people screaming bloody murder because my site has an error, or they want to look at a piece of code. The last thing I want to do when I get home is to &#8220;help&#8221; people. That&#8217;s what I do all day at work. Give me time to sit down, eat dinner, get out of my work clothes, read a comic or three and then I&#8217;ll jump straight back into working on fixing whatever bugs you may find. I&#8217;ll even be nice.</p>

<p>You may realise by now that there isn&#8217;t a blog post before this one. This is because some idiot (me) forgot to backup his MySQL database, I had everything else backed up except that. It only had one blog post in it anyway, and I wish to re-write it. The blog post was titled &#8220;Goodbye, Good Luck and Get Out of my Store&#8221; and here&#8217;s how I want to write it today:</p>

<p>Dear Customers, I have been working at Coles for 2 years, 2 months and 6 days now. It&#8217;s time for me to leave, I have found another job somewhere else, that pays more and has better working conditions (including chairs). You may know me as the &#8220;spiky-haired guy&#8221; or the &#8220;one-with-the-grumpy-face&#8221;, but that&#8217;s only some of the time. I can be nice, but sometimes it takes a little incentive. That&#8217;s just how I am. I would like to address you in groups.</p>

<p><span>b</span>The Elderly<span>/b</span> I don&#8217;t know how you do it, but every day you manage to bring in those green bags of yours. Equally repetitive is your famous catch-cry of &#8220;Hold on, Dear! I have green bags.&#8221; as I start scanning them items you put up before your green bags.</p>

<p>Yes, you can be slow, and lets face it, I&#8217;m an impatient bastard, but you do eventually give me a friendly smile and say goodbye. This makes you unique, in a special way. You can give me the correct change most of the time also, which is sometimes a good thing.</p>

<p><span>b</span>The Asians<span>/b</span> If it wasn&#8217;t for your consistent buying of discounted items our bins would be over-flowing with out of date stock. You are reliable, efficient and smart. You stare at the monitor looking for mistakes, and if there&#8217;s one you kindly remind me. Sometimes I&#8217;ll miss one, but you can just go up to the Service Desk and get your 18c refund.</p>

<p><span>b</span>The People Who Talk On Mobile Phones Whilst Being Served<span>/b</span> I find you funny, most of the time. Other times you&#8217;re tolerable, but I would prefer it if you put your mother on hold for the &lt; 2 minutes it takes me to serve you. You don&#8217;t need to shout &#8220;HELLO?!&#8221; down the phone. We don&#8217;t get signal in the building. Don&#8217;t ignore me when I tell you that we don&#8217;t, believe me, I&#8217;ve tried.</p>

<p>In short: Hang up, at least say &#8220;hello&#8221; to me, get served, get out, and then call them back when you&#8217;re not inside.</p>

<p><span>b</span>The Parents With Screaming Kids<span>/b</span> This is Coles. Last I know, Coles is not a kindergarten, crech, or any other child-care facility. I respect the fact that you don&#8217;t want to leave your kids home alone, or in the car, but please, keep them under control when you&#8217;re in the store. Occasionally I&#8217;m tempted to call security because your children are being absolute ferals. Control your kids.</p>

<p>Aside: Apparently I used to be one of those kids too. Thankfully, they grow up.</p>

<p><span>b</span>FlyBuys users<span>/b</span> Lets point out a few points that you should know during the transactional process:</p>

<ol>
<li>Before handing me the cash, it is wise to hand me the flybuys card. You may also do this during the process, but not after. I have very quick fingers that like to hit the Cash -&gt; Enter button. My job is to scan your items and get you out of the store.</li>

<li>You can not use your FlyBuys on the $1.00 bread you bought. It only works for amounts of $5 and over.</li>

<li>You get 2 points / $5. Get a life, seriously.</li>

<li>If I &#8220;forget&#8221; to ask you, it&#8217;s not my fault. Would you be sick of asking for FlyBuys for every customer?</li>
</ol>

<p>For this point let&#8217;s elaborate some. Say, on average, it takes me 1 minute to serve customers (on express). Over a 9 hour day I take 1 1/2 hours for lunch &amp; tea breaks. So that&#8217;s 7.5 hours, or 450 minutes. So that&#8217;s 450 times I have to ask for FlyBuys. Not going to happen.</p>

<p>That is, unless someone can provide me with a YakBak. Those things were cool back in the day.</p>}]]></content>
