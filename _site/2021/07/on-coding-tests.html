              <h2>On coding tests</h2>
            </a>
            <small>27 Jul 2021</small>
          </div>
          <p>As you might know, I’ve been <a href="https://ryanbigg.com/2021/07/job-hunt-q2-2021">job hunting recently</a>. I’m at the part of this step for some companies where we’ve had our initial conversation and now they want me to do a coding test.</p>

<p>But that’s okay, because it “should only take up to 3 hours to do”. Now let’s theoretically say that I’m talking with 5 companies now. That’s <em>15 hours</em> of my time, that I have to pull out of work, life or sleep, to do these coding tests. All to prove to them that I can code!</p>

<p>This strikes me as odd because I’m pretty sure I can code.</p>

<p>I’ve been employed as a developer in one way or another since 2004. That’s 17 years! I’ve had to pass other coding tests in the past to get some of those jobs. I had a lot more free time in my youth and wasn’t such a crotchety old man like I am now.</p>

<p>I’ve <a href="https://ryanbigg.com/books">written books</a> where I try to teach other people how to code. If I don’t know how to code, how could I teach other people to code? Mystery!</p>

<p>I’ve recently <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWdyo3icsjU">released a 6-part screencast series</a> where I demonstrate my ability to code in not one, but THREE different languages <strong>AT THE SAME TIME</strong>! I’m clearly not a 10x developer. Maybe a 3x developer?</p>

<p>I’ve even made the <a href="https://github.com/radar/twist-v2">codebase from that screencast series completely open source</a>.</p>

<p>I’m also responsible for maintaining the <a href="https://github.com/ruby-i18n/i18n">12th-most-downloaded Ruby Gem – i18n</a>. Yeah, this is code that I’ve (unlikely) written or (likely) vetted &amp; approved that’s <em>probably running in your Rails application right now</em>.</p>

<p>But no, these things don’t count for <em>anything</em> in the interview process. Maybe I’ve gone too far down the path of tying my self-worth up in these things. The way I feel is: if you don’t value these things I’ve <em>already done</em>, then you do not value me.</p>

<hr />

<p>I can read the replies now:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>but how do we know that you really know how to code, according to our 100% bias-free baseline?</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>We have subjected our other developers to this antiquated hazing ritual so why shouldn’t we subject you to the same?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Fact is, you don’t. Some people can code really well in interviews and have had lots of practice answering how exactly you go about reversing a purple linked list uphill both ways in the snow. Some people struggle with the pressure of developing something <em>completely solo</em> and then having that scruitinised in an hour-long live-code-review session.</p>

<p>I’m personally <em>done</em> with being hazed in this way. You know I can code. I have proven this with my long tenure in this industry and the stuff I’ve put out in the world.</p>

<p>Let’s just get down to business. I’ll happily trade labour for dollars. Hold the haze. Use the books, code and screencast I’ve already put out in order to judge my abilities.</p>
