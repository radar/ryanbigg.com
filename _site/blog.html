      <h2 class="mt-4 post-title">Why game programming and why Magic?</h2>
    </a>
    <small>07 Feb 2023</small>
  </div>
  <p>For about the past 5 months, I’ve been fiddling with a little Ruby project called <a href="https://github.com/radar/mtg">“Magic: The Gathering: The Ruby Project”</a>. It’s my attempt to make Magic: The Gathering, in Ruby.</p>

<p>But why game programming when my forté is web programming, and why <em>this</em> game specifically? Why not Uno?</p>

<p>Because I wanted a challenge!</p>

<p>I had played Magic first <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/magic-the-gathering-arena/id1496227521">through their Arena app on iOS</a>, which (mostly) works, save a few little issues here and there. Last year I started playing Magic weekly at a local game shop in town. I love the different mechanics of the different cards and figuring out how they all interact best. <em>Especially</em> when they syngerise together.</p>

<p>What’s appealing about this game is that while there’s a rulebook (I’ll get to that in a minute), the <em>cards themselves</em> make up the rules. If the creators want to change the rules of the game, they can print more cards with different text on them.</p>

<p>This is Rule 101.1 of Magic:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>101.1. Whenever a card’s text directly contradicts these rules, the card takes precedence.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Some of the cards are simple, like <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/a25/33/savannah-lions">Savannah Lions</a>. It costs one white mana to play, and it has 2 power and 1 toughness.</p>

<p>Others, like <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/eld/171/questing-beast">Questing Beast</a> with all its words, and <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/isd/181/garruk-relentless-garruk-the-veil-cursed">Garruk Relentless</a> with all its words on one side, <em>and then even more words on the other side</em>, are not so simple.</p>

<p>This Rule 101.1, the <em>first</em> of Magic’s several “Golden Rules”, is contained in <a href="https://media.wizards.com/2023/downloads/MagicCompRules%2020230203.pdf">this two-hundred-and-seventy-eight PDF page document</a>, where all of Magic’s non-card-defined rules are written down. Some of the rules even have examples with them.</p>

<p>If you wanted to find out all of the creature types, you’d look at Rule 205.3m.</p>

<p>Want to know how combat is designed to run? Start on page 74 with Rule 506, and finish on Page 84 with rule 511.</p>

<hr />

<p>Now this MTG-in-Ruby project is not a line-for-line reproduction of the rulebook or even a card-for-card replication attempt from A-Z. It started as an attempt to reproduce the features of a stack of random cards that were on my desk, and progressed from there to attempting to implement all of the <a href="https://scryfall.com/sets/m21?as=grid&amp;order=set">Core Set 2021</a> cards. I needed to set myself a goal, and even though that goal is <em>extremely ambitious</em>, it’s still a goal and something to aim for.</p>

<p>I’ve gotten most of the white cards done, and that leaves only about 300 more cards of that set. And <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Magic:_The_Gathering_sets">there are quite a few sets</a> .</p>

<p>What I’m particularly proud of here is that I have a clean DSL for being able to define cards and their abilities. For a simple card like <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/khm/34/story-seeker">Story Seeker</a>, I can define it like:</p>

<pre><code class="language-ruby">module Magic
  module Cards
    StorySeeker = Creature("Story Seeker") do
      cost generic: 1, white: 1
      type "Creature -- Dwarf Cleric"
      keywords :lifelink
      power 2
      toughness 2
    end
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>The one thing here I’d change is making those types into constants rather than being strings. I’ve been too lazy to address that yet, as it hasn’t been a problem. Here’s a quick riff on what that might look like:</p>

<pre><code class="language-ruby">module Magic
  module Cards
    StorySeeker = Creature("Story Seeker") do
      cost generic: 1, white: 1
      type Types::Creature[:Dwarf, :Cleric]
      keywords :lifelink
      power 2
      toughness 2
    end
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>While writing this post I built <a href="https://github.com/radar/mtg/commit/8cb9efe66248a1672d0e56a04bc8e92d19209385">this exact interface</a>. I’d love to go back to revisit it sometime to handle when an <em>invalid</em> type is passed, but it’ll work for the time-being.</p>

<hr />

<p>The cards themselves are <em>usually</em> straightforward to implement. It’s how they interact that’s the tricky part. For this, I try to come up with scenarios that might happen in real games, and then model those in the tests themselves.</p>

<p>One of these that I’m particularly proud about is the mana-cost-reducing effect of <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/nec/152/foundry-inspector">Foundry Inspector</a>. I started working on this card by writing the test for it first and working up from there.</p>

<pre><code class="language-ruby"> require 'spec_helper'

RSpec.describe Magic::Game, "Mana spend -- Foundry Inspector + Free Sol Ring" do
  include_context "two player game"

  context "when at first main phase" do
    before do
      current_turn.untap!
      current_turn.upkeep!
      current_turn.draw!
      current_turn.first_main!
    end

    context "foundry inspector reduces sol ring cost" do
      let(:foundry_inspector) { Card("Foundry Inspector") }
      let(:sol_ring) { Card("Sol Ring") }

      before do
        p1.hand.add(foundry_inspector)
        p1.hand.add(sol_ring)
      end

      it "casts a foundry inspector and then a sol ring" do
        p1.add_mana(red: 3)
        action = Magic::Actions::Cast.new(player: p1, card: foundry_inspector)
        expect(action.can_perform?).to eq(true)
        action.pay_mana(generic: { red: 3 } )
        game.take_action(action)
        game.tick!

        action = Magic::Actions::Cast.new(player: p1, card: sol_ring)
        expect(action.can_perform?).to eq(true)
        game.take_action(action)

        game.tick!
        expect(p1.permanents.by_name(sol_ring.name).count).to eq(1)
      end
    end
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>The body of the test ensures that we can pay 3 red mana to cast the Foundry Inspector, and then by casting that we can then cast the <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/dmc/190/sol-ring">Sol Ring</a> by not paying any mana at all. It finishes by using some more DSL code to ensure that the Sol Ring has been registered as a permanent controlled by Player 1.</p>

<hr />

<p>If you’re looking for where the proverbial bodies are buried on this particular project, well, there are <em>plenty</em>. This project was coded up over nights, after work and sometimes even after a glass of Port or two. Caution was thrown to the wind, and past that.</p>

<p>The worst of it would be demonstrated in <code>attacking_creature_creates_attacking_token_spec.rb</code>, where a card called <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/m21/18/falconer-adept">Falconer Adept</a> has a triggered ability of:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Whenever Falconer Adept attacks, create a 1/1 white Bird creature token with flying that’s tapped and attacking.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What this means is that you can declare that Falconer Adept is attacking as a part of the <em>regular</em> “Declare Attackers” phase of combat, and then by doing that, a different game object (a Bird token) is created, where you will need to delcare what that Bird token is attacking. In effect, “Declare Attackers” happens <em>twice</em>.</p>

<p>You can see how this code is handled in the <code>Turn</code> class’s state machine, particularly anywhere the <code>final_attackers_declared</code> method is used.</p>

<p>This one took me a <em>long</em> time to implement.</p>

<hr />

<p>I like fiddling with this project. It’s outside my regular wheelhouse and is teaching me more about event-driven game programming.</p>

<p>If I get stuck on a card, it’s not like I <em>have</em> to implement it. There’s thousands more out there to choose from.</p>

<p>I’d suggest if your interested in practicing some Ruby code outside of the usual web sphere to find <a href="https://scryfall.com/random">a card at random</a> and attempting to impelment it here. Or if you’re looking for something more challenging, have a read through of this code and see if you can refactor it to handle certain events or effects in a more straightforward way.</p>
