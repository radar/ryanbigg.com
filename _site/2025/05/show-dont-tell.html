          <p>On Monday night, I’m going to be on a panel in Melbourne, in front of a crowd of aspirational junior developers, answering questions and giving advice. I’ve been <a href="https://ryanbigg.com/2018/03/hiring-juniors">a proponent for junior developers for a very long time</a>, and ran two successful iterations of my Junior Engineering Program at Culture Amp, ending in 2019, as well as continuing to mentor developers in my current line of work.</p>

<p>My advice to the juniors of 2025 is plain and simple: <strong>Show, Don’t Tell.</strong> The first time I hear from a lot of juniors is probably when they apply for a job, or reach out about one. It used to be meetups but the tyranny of distance got in the way.</p>

<p>When they reach out, that’s when I’ll find out the regular things of what tools they’ve used. HTML, CSS, JavaScript, some framework or another. Catch me on a good day (most of them) and I’ll even take a look at their GitHub profiles and portfolios. I’m a curious sort of guy.</p>

<p>The ones that stand out the most do a really great job of <em>showing</em> me that they know the tools, and that they’ve gone past a first tutorial stage.</p>

<ul>
  <li>A React app that ranks your favourite books, then orders them by read date, then reorders them by cover colour.</li>
  <li>A game you made because you had an idea you couldn’t leave behind. Yes, even if the game is naff.</li>
  <li>Show me a thing I didn’t think CSS could do, ever.</li>
</ul>

<p>All of this goes a long way to showing me an aptitude that already puts you ahead of 90% of the competition. These are the outliers I will notice and think more about.</p>

<p>So: <em>Show me</em> what you can do, rather than giving me a list of tools. A Luthier and I both know how to use a saw, but only one of us knows how to make a guitar. The proof is in the doing, not the telling.</p>

<p><small>(And for god sake: use a colour other than black and white on your resumé!)</small></p>
