          <p>Our job as software developers is to make functional software.</p>

<p>A user should be able to use our software to accomplish tasks that might otherwise take a long time if they were doing it without computers. This has a wide-and-varied range, of course. But the main thing is that we need to make software <em>that works</em>.</p>

<p>If we didn’t do that, we would find ourselves out of a job very quickly.</p>

<p>However, functional software shouldn’t just be the only thing we strive for.</p>

<p>We should also strive to eliminiate rough edges in our software. We can do this through a process of quality assurance testing, introspection and by plain old taking feedback from our users <em>and acting on it</em>.</p>

<p>We need to listen to real user feedback, discover what the rough edges are in our software and work to eliminate the roughness.</p>

<p>For users of our software this can look like:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A page that takes 10 seconds to load <em>is a rough edge</em>. Could we make it load in 5 seconds, or under a second? Why are our users waiting so long?</li>
  <li>A process that takes a user several clicks through tricky menus <em>is a rough edge</em>. Can we make a shortcut for common user flows instead?</li>
  <li>A part of our application that works on browsers, but not on mobile <em>is a rough edge</em>. Can we make that page responsive and useable on devices smaller than a 30” desktop or 13” laptop?</li>
  <li>A feature that works in one part of our application, but not in another <em>is a rough edge</em>. A feature should work in predictable ways, everywhere. For instance: <code>/collapse</code> works in the main Slack window, but not in threads. Why not?</li>
</ul>

<p>Rough edges in software are human-software interaction problems. They should be treated at the same level as a bug or as an exception. A rough edge <em>is an exceptional thing</em>.</p>

<p>We must work to make functional, smooth software that is pleasing to use. Software that is as free as rough edges as we can make it.</p>
