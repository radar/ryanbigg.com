          <p>I recently upgraded from a 2015 MacBook Pro to a 2018 MacBook Pro. And by
“recently”, I mean back at the start of June. I wanted a new MacBook Pro because of the faster performance that a new computer would give me. Work (Culture Amp) was also upgrading their fleet of Macs and I was one of the lucky people to get a new one.</p>

<p>So I’ve been using this computer as a work computer for almost 3 months now and, my god, the keyboard <em>drives me mental</em>. Even writing this blog post now on the train and there’s:</p>

<ul>
  <li>duplicated “o’s” that I’ve had to go back and fix, or missing ones – guess how fun it is to write <a href="https://leanpub.com/elixir-toyrobot">a book about a Toy Robot</a> with this particular problem</li>
  <li>double spaces – or no spaces</li>
  <li>a Command key that registers 9 out of every 10 times</li>
  <li>words like “times” that inexplicably get spelled like “timies”, or “about” that gets spelled like “abouot”</li>
</ul>

<p>Apple is <em>all about</em> the thinness of their laptops. I do not particularly care about the thinness of this device. For the most part, it sits on one of two desks that I use or it sits on my lap on the train. <em>Maybe</em> I use it on the couch from time-to-time. I do not care about the thinness of this device <em>while I am using it</em>. I only care about it when I store it away, in my backpack.</p>

<p>This keyboard has a key travel distance that, I am sure, is measured in microns or perhaps nanometers. It feels like I am typing on a concrete slab. Key presses inexplicably duplicate. Or don’t register at all. All for <em>thinness</em>.</p>

<p>This keyboard is a catastrophic engineering failure, designed by a company that should know better. A company with more money in the bank than several countries <em>combined</em>. This keyboard would be, by far, the part of the MacBook Pro that is used the <em>most</em> by everybody who owns one, and it is so poorly engineered for the pursuit of <em>thinness</em>.</p>

<p>Apple <em>must</em> fix this problem in their upcoming MacBook Pro releases. I want a <em>fat</em> MacBook pro keyboard, one that has a travel distance of the older wireless keyboards and doesn’t have that “concrete slab” feel. I want to be able to type <em>an entire paragraph</em> without having to go back and correct things because the keyboard failed.</p>

<p>I am tired of having to correct what I type because of this keyboard’s faults. I am tired of having to use external keyboards to actually <em>enjoy</em> using this computer. I love the Mac and it’s software and how things <em>just</em> work. But I will leave if this keyboard farce continues.</p>

<p>If Apple releases their new Macs with an <em>identical</em> keyboard, then I’m ditching Macs and will pick up a Microsoft Surface Book or something similar. Whatever it is, I’ll make sure to pick a laptop that has <em>a god damned functional keyboard</em>.</p>
