              <h2>The Mystery of The Wardrobes</h2>
            </a>

          <p>Excuse the [url=/img/other/wardrobes.jpg]very nasty lens flare[/url], but two wardrobes popped up either side of our front door this morning. I don’t know where they came from, why they are there and who dropped them off. One can assume that whoever did drop them off had no need for it and, judging by [url=/img/other/stickers.jpg]the stickers on the inside of one of the doors[/url] the person who delivered them, or a relative of theirs, aspired to be in the air force.</p>

<p>Other than that there is nothing really remarkable about them. One of them has a [url=/img/other/mirror.jpg]”full-length” mirror[/url] with a small crack in the top left on the inside of the left door, and on the top shelf it has [url=/img/other/hooks.jpg]hooks to hang something small (approx 30cm to shelf)[/url]. Each door has a lock (as seen in the mirror photo), and there [url=/img/other/keys.jpg]were four keys on the door step[/url] (only three are pictured, we used one to see if there was anything inside).</p>

<p>What’s really strange is, two weeks ago I moved into mum’s house and I don’t have a wardrobe, so I’ve kept my clothes in plastic tubs and work clothes on a make-shift clothes rack. Mum was talking about buying a wardrobe for me, and I don’t know if she is going to now that these have rocked up.</p>

<p>Who put them there? Come on, fess up.</p>
