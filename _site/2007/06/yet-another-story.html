          <p>Another work of fiction based on my obsessive need to tell people not to press the damn button over and over again! I suppress it usually.</p>

<p>One day on the way to work I was walking my usual route through town. I walked up to a set of traffic lights and found one of my friends pushing the button over and over again. I walked closer and said, “You know it doesn’t matter how many times you push that button, it isn’t going to change any faster.
“Hi Ryan.” He replied.
“Did you know the energy you put into pushing that button could be better spent increasing your cranial capacity?”
“I do now”, he said, still pushing the button.
“The first time someone pushes the button it inserts a single function into the cycle of the lights, basically telling the “don’t walk” sign at the other end to change to a “walk” sign if the button is pressed. You could press it a billion times, although I don’t think you’d have enough time between light changes.” The light changed, and we walked across the street. “Do you know the powers of 2 from 1 to 20? The first 20 elements? The Theory of Relativity?”
“Do you know how to change a tyre?” He retorted.
“I’ve done it a few times.
“What about how to get a girlfriend?”
“You’re one to ask.”
“At least I don’t turn to mush when they talk to me.”
“That’s a lie and you know it! You’re worse than me!”
As we arrived at the next set of lights, my friend continued pushing the button.
“I’ll wave to you at my Nobel Prize ceremony.” I said. “I’ll talk to you later.”
“Asshole!” he shouted at me.
“Proud of it!” I shouted back, walking into the building.</p>
