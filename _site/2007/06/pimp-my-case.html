              <h2>Pimp My Case!</h2>
            </a>

          <p>For those of you that don’t know, there’s a show out called “Pimp My Ride!”. On the show, people give their cars to a group of pros (Xzibit and his crew) and they pimp out the ride, adding overkill entertainment systems and generally making the rides look sweet.</p>

<p>My mum’s friend Charmaine was having computer troubles a while back, I thought I would be nice and go over there and check it out and, hopefully, fix the issue. The Computer, and I use that term very loosely, was running Windows 98. 98 was released in, you guessed it, 1998, making it nine years old.</p>

<p>That’s about 90 years in real life. It’s old. It’s fragile. It whines at everything. It’s ugly.</p>

<p>To top it off, the computer is running on 200mhz with 32mb of RAM. It has a freakin’ turbo button for God’s sake! I suppose I should mention now that she’s on dial-up too.</p>

<p>Now if you look at [url=/img/pimpmycase/old-case-back.jpg]the back of the case[/url] you will notice many things:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The case is U shaped, meaning the top and both sides come off in one piece.</li>
  <li>It’s old and dusty.</li>
  <li>There’s no PS/2 ports.</li>
  <li>There’s no USB ports.</li>
  <li>It has an RS232 port.</li>
  <li>It has a parallel port.</li>
  <li>It has a serial port.</li>
  <li>It makes your eyes water.</li>
</ol>

<p>Originally I brought around my m-robe, thinking I’ll be able to put some programs on the computer and fix her problems, but without a USB port there was no chance of that happening.</p>

<p>During the first time I was there Charmaine talked about eventually upgrading the computer. She mentioned that she might consider it more after she returned from her trip to Canada.</p>

<p>She returned a few weekends ago and her husband gave me some cash for a new everything. Here’s what I got her:
Motherboard: Asus AM2-940 M2N8-VMX $65
RAM: 1GB DDR2 667 5300 $45
Monitor: Viewsonic 17” VA703B 8ms $215
Power Supply: 550 Max. SHAW PSU $25
Case: CM Ammo RC-533 $89
Keyboard: Multimedia Slim Keyboard $7
Mouse: Generic Optical Mouse $7
DVD Drive: Samsung 18x Black DVD-RW $38
CPU: AM2-940 x2 Dual Core 3600+ $88
Harddrive: 80GB Maxtor $50</p>

<p>Total: $629.00
Budget: $650.00</p>

<p>I only got the CPU because they were out of the 3200s and I didn’t want to wait another week for them to order in the parts and go to the trouble of having to go down there again.</p>

<p>This is a whole system and that’s an awesome price. Now for a very-near bleeding edge kit you’d pay something like $2.5k.</p>

<p>Anyway, there’s some pics of the new case and associated other things at [url=/img/pimpmycase]Pimp My Case[/url]. Enjoy.</p>
