          <p>I was on the train last night coming from Adelaide to my station and around Nurlutta (about 6 stops away from station) this Aboriginal guy gets on. Instantly this smell infiltrates my nostrils and I fight back the urge to show the guy what I ate for lunch. The worst part is he sat across from me. He mumbled a few things and I completely ignored him.</p>

<p>BUT THIS SMELL WAS UNHOLY. Score +1 for proof there isn’t a God. Think of everything bad you’ve ever smelt and concentrate it on one person. I am not over-exaggerating. This is what he smelt like, everything unholy and more.</p>

<p>So I moved one seat up so I could be closer to the door and get the fresh air faster than anyone else in the train. I tried to slow my breathing, holding my breath and so on, but it kept coming back. When the door would open I would subtly lean towards the door and take long deep breaths of the lovely fresh air.</p>

<p>The worst part is that when I got off the train, I could still smell it faintly on my jumper.</p>

<p>It should be a criminal offense, classified under the bio-weapon law umbrella, it was DEVASTATING. I can not stress that enough.</p>

<p>How can people even get to that stage? How can people even let other people get to that stage? Wouldn’t they notice <em>something</em>?</p>

<hr />

<p>I know this is getting too much of a habit, putting two blogs in one post, but what are you going to do about it?</p>

<p>I ordered some computer parts for my computer and a friend’s computer, from [url=http://msy.com.au]a certain computer store[/url]. WARNING WEBSITE MAY DESTROY ALL HOPE. It was a clear list of what I wanted, and I assumed they would just email me back and tell me when they were ready to be picked up. No such event occurred, so I phoned them up yesterday and was told that they don’t hold parts for people for more than 2 days. They could’ve at least told me that in an email, but no response. This is poor customer service, and I’m considering taking my money (a lot of it) somewhere else.</p>

<p>Here’s what I ordered:</p>

<p>Friend’s Computer
Motherboard: Asus M2N8
CPU: AN2 Sempron 3000+
RAM: 1gb-667 Generic
Monitor: 17” Viewsonic VA703B-8ms
Power Supply: SHAW 550W
Case: Coolermaster Ammo RC533
Keyboard: Slim Black-Sliver Keyboard
Mouse: USB Optical</p>

<p>Parts for mine:
CPU: Intel Core 2 Duo E6600
Graphics Card: 640MB 8800GTS Leadtek</p>

<p>That’s about $1,000 right there. So now I have to re-order all that crap in, I might stop by their store today and verbally order it.</p>
