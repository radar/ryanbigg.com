          <p>“Yeah, it’s a tomorrow problem.” I said yesterday in regards to installing Ubuntu on the development server at work. Little did I know that it would cause so many hassles.</p>

<p>First of all the mirror at http://au.archive.ubuntu.org didn’t have some packages, so I changed that to mirror.internode.on.net and that seemed to fix everything except for the nginx package. So I changed “dapper” to “feisty” in /etc/apt/sources.list and it found it and installed it. Then it decided to remove/alter some key features. That wasn’t good. I tried compiling imagemagick, and that failed with a “cannot compile executable” error (which there are only ~700,000 results for on Google!). Then I tried doing apt-get install build-essential. That needed libc-dev which needed lib6c-dev, which needed gcc, which needed libc-dev. See my conundrum?</p>

<p>So I hooked up the dev server to the Internode connection and pulled a cool 1mb/sec off their mirror and downloaded 7.04-server in just under 6 minutes. So I burnt that to another disk and went to install it, it got up to “Selecting and Installing Software” and hangs at 85% on update-manager-core.</p>

<p>EDIT: I have just tried installing it on my server, and it hangs at precisely the same point. I’m going to leave it on overnight and see if it progresses any further.</p>

<p>EDIT #2 (14th June 07): I was watching Medium last night and I heard the CD-drive open. I turned on my screen to see ubuntu had finished installing. Apparently it takes a while at that point. Also, you may need to do “sudo apt-get install update-manager-core”. I didn’t, thankfully, but I did see it automatically included in one of the installs I did this morning.</p>

<p>It’s a tomorrow problem.</p>

<p>They also have a weird network setup. Five of the computers in the office seem to be on a Telstra connection (around 50kb/s), which goes something like PC -&gt; another PC -&gt; another PC -&gt; Routr -&gt; Internet, and the rest of the computers in the office are on an Internode connection (around 900-1200kb/s) which goes something like PC -&gt; Router -&gt; Internet.</p>

<p>All of the computers are plugged into the same switch, yet it’s connecting to a different network. Maybe I’ll have to have a play around with the route settings tomorrow.</p>
