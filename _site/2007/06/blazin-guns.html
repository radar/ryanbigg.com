          <p>Today I went shooting at the Marksman Security Training &amp; Indoor Range on Franklin Street in the city with Tom, his dad, his uncle and his dad’s friend.</p>

<p>It was $60 each for the five of us and we got to fire:</p>

<p>30x 9mm Glock semi-auto
10x 45ACP Glock semi-auto
12x .357 Magnum revolver
6x .44 Magnum revolver</p>

<p>Firstly we watched a training video on how to use the guns and what safety precautions to follow, stuff like don’t point the gun at other people, always aim it down range and how to reload it.</p>

<p>Then we went into the “Range A” area, where we went through again the precautions and how to load and fire the two Glocks. I was much more accurate with the 9mm Glock due to the lower recoil on it, the 45ACP was a larger gun with more of a recoil, and it shot more to the left of where I thought I was aiming it.</p>

<p>After Range A, we moved into Range B where we fired the Magnums. We were pre-warned that we may experience “a slightly more powerful recoil” and I was surprised at exactly how much recoil these things had. The .357 wasn’t too bad, but the reload time wasn’t ideal, I guess someone who uses this gun in a real life situation would be more proficient at reloading than what I was. The .44 was nuts! You load up this massive revolver with 6 shots and you expect a similar recoil to the .357 but it’s nearly twice as much, it jars the whole arm, then you have another 5 shots to go.</p>

<p>9mm results:

<p>And I collected two shells from the magnums</p>

<p>Was a wonderful time and I would suggest it to anyone who wants a way to rid themselves very quickly of $60.</p>
