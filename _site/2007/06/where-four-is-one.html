          <p>I received my new laptop last night and after exorcising Vista successfully I am now happily running Ubuntu with a few minor issues. When I right click on the time and click the Adjust button, it presents me with the password dialog box for “time-admin”, I enter my password and nothing happens. Obviously this program is not installed, and I have tried apt-get install time-admin and it’s not in there, but apart from that everything’s smooth.</p>

<p>I received my new motherboard today, an Abit F-I90HD, minus the RAM that needs to go in it to get working. So now I have a motherboard inside my shuttle case with an awesome CPU (E6600) and graphics card (8800GTS), but no RAM. Tomorrow’s a RAM shopping day.</p>

<p>I also have a motherboard not in any case, with CPU, RAM, on-board graphics , a spare IDE cable and a case to put it in, so tomorrow I’m going to put the components in a spare case.</p>

<p>As for my old computer (which really isn’t that old), I’m selling the parts. There’s a motherboard (Gigabite GA-K8NS-Pro) with an AMD Sempron 3100+, one DDR2 333 stick of 512mb RAM, one DD2 400 stick of 512mb RAM, an nVidia 6600GT and a Creative SB0230 Sound Card. I think my uncle John wanted the video card, but everything else is up for grabs. My brother’s offering me $50 for the motherboard with the CPU, which is ridiculous (I hope you’re reading this Scott).</p>

<p>At the moment only one of the four “computers” in my room is operational, and that’s my laptop. Tomorrow’s going to be fun. Goodbye weekend.</p>
