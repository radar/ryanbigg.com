          <p>Here’s some common false myths about traffic lights that people seem to live by:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>The traffic lights will never change again. You do not need to run when the little man is still green or flashing. If the traffic light for the traffic going your direction has changed orange, and you’re still in the middle of the crossing, do not dawdle. You will get beeped at. If you are 100m away and the light has just changed, do not run. Not only do you look like a complete idiot when you do, even if you walked you could’ve still made the lights. If you do not make it by the time the light has gone red and the traffic going your direction’s light has gone orange, do not attempt to cross. You will again get beeped at. Wait patiently on the corner, press the button, and wait until the light once again goes green. I promise you it will.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Pressing the button a billion times makes the lights change quicker. When you press the button the first time to cross the road, this inserts a small statement into the traffic light’s programmed loop that basically is “turn the light green and make the things make the noise”. Further subsequent button pushes do not magically make the traffic lights some how speedier.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Along with that, slamming the traffic light button does not make it change faster. It is not a strength contest. You will not win a prize if you slam it so hard the clink can be heard on the opposite corner.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>And here’s some they have about trains:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>There are no more trains for the rest of the day. People will run at 5:53 to get on the 5:53 train. I see it happen every day. The train LEAVES at 5:53. If you are still running at 5:53 to get on the 5:53, you are wasting your energy. There’s another train, 12 minutes after it. I’m sure waiting for it won’t kill you.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Train seats are luggage storage. Every day I see someone put their bags on the seat next to them . The train inevitably gets full and people are left standing up whilst these people have their little bags on the seats people could be on. Here’s something you might not have thought of. Take the bag off the seat, and put it on your lap. Hey presto, a free seat and your stuff’s still safe! Or even, put it on the floor if there is no one across from you.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Everyone else doesn’t mind listening to what shops you looked at. When having mobile phone conversations, it is not necessary to dictate your entire 45-minute conversation in the loudest voice possible. Mobile phone technology has come a long way, and so you, believe it or not, are able to speak as if the person is right next to you, in a low-civilized manner. If I wanted to know what shops you looked at, I would approach you and ask you. I honestly don’t care that you visited JeansWest.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>That is all.</p>
