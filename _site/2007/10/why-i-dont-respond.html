          <p>Many people that read this blog have my MSN address. For those of you who do not have my MSN address there is probably a good reason for it.</p>

<p>All times mentioned are Australian Central Time +0930 GMT, but in a week they will be +1030 GMT thanks to Daylight “Savings”</p>

<p>I would like to remind all of my readers (all 3 of you) that I actually have a job. This job involves me leaving my computer at near enough 7:40am every morning. Then I drive down to the train station, park my car, walk to the train station, wait for the train, get on the train, ride the train to Adelaide, get off the train and then walk to work (1.7km, the whole distance of Adelaide). I arrive at work at 9:00am. This means there is a whole period of 1 hour and 20 minutes where I am incommunicado. Do not leave me messages between 7:40am and 9:00am expecting a reply. You won’t get one until 7pm.</p>

<p>I arrive at work at 9:00am and generally then sign back in to messenger. You may leave me a message or attempt to strike up a conversation with me, but I am at work and whilst I’m here I am paid to work, not to speak to you.</p>

<p>IF my job DID involve speaking to you, that would be wonderful. Getting paid to talk to people about nothing in particular. 
It’s not. 
Don’t think it is.</p>

<p>I am at work until 5:30pm. This is a time that I almost always leave by. The only times where I may be still within reach are when there are Ruby Users Group meetings on (second Tuesday of every month), or I have taken the day off work because I am sick or for other reasons (there has only been one day in the past 5 months when I’ve done that, gg cold). If you send me a message after 5:30pm, but before 7:15pm, you will most likely not receive a reply until 9am the next day, if you’re still online. If you’re not then you have no hope of a reply unless you say whatever you said before.</p>

<p>If you are messaging me on a Tuesday that is not the second Tuesday of the month, or a Thursday immediately following a Ruby Users Group Tuesday, I am over my Dad’s house for dinner 99.9999% of the time. This means I am incommunicado from 5:30pm up until most probably 8:15pm. During this time I finish work, walk to the train station, wait for the train, get on the train, ride the train to Elizabeth, get off the train, walk to my car, drive to dad’s house, eat dinner, talk, drive back to mum’s house, and then log in to MSN.</p>

<p>If it is a weekday and after 10:00pm and I’m still online, this means I have left my computer on.  It also means that I am sleeping. I will not reply until 7:00am the next morning.</p>

<p>That just about covers it.</p>
