          <p><a href="https://leanpub.com/multi-tenancy-rails-2/c/fin">Multitenancy with Rails 2nd edition</a> is now “content complete”. I have now finished doing the majority of the work on this book and all that is left is to go through it and “proof” it.</p>

<p>The book has been updated for Rails 4.2 and uses industry best practices of
building a multitenanted Rails application, and the best practices of using
Braintree or Stripe to add subscription features to that application.</p>

<p><strong>If you’ve read <a href="http://manning.com/bigg2">Rails 4 in Action</a> or something of a
similar level to that, this book is a perfect “next step” for you. It adds
features which are more complicated than a basic “CRUD” app to an existing
codebase. If that appeals to you, <a href="https://leanpub.com/multi-tenancy-rails-2/c/fin">use the coupon code “fin” to get 50% off</a>.</strong></p>

<p>This update has been quite a long time coming: it took me 298 days from when I
started updating Chapter 1 to this current point. Next up, I’ll go through the
book and make sure there’s as few bugs and typos as possible. Once I’m done
with that, then I will consider the book to be complete.</p>

<p>Thanks everyone for buying this book, reading it and providing feedback along the way.</p>
