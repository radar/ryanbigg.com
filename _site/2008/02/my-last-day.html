            <p>It’s been a while, but two Fridays ago was my last day working for SeaLink, well, for this contract anyway. You never know if I might get a new contract with them further down the road and I would love to come back and work with those amazing people.</p>

<p>I completed their online bookings “module” for their site as the last thing I did before I left, and it seemed they really appreciate it. I even got a better card than what Coles gave me, this one was actually bought from a shop instead of written hastily on receipt paper.  Written in it was:</p>
<blockquote>"Dear Ryan,
Thank you for all your help &amp; friendship and best of luck with the next exciting chapter of your life. Keep in touch &amp; we all look forward to hear from you.
All the best
Ali."

"Dear Ryan,
It was good working with you at your blistering  pace :) Have fun, and I'll see you at next Ruby meetup.
Anuj."

"Dear Ryan,
It has been a pleasure working with you. Thank you for your hard work &amp; best wishes for the future.
Michael"

"Dear Ryan,
It was great to work with you. hope you do great things in future... Good luck with your next assignment!  Have fun!!! Keep in touch.
Vish"

"Dear Ryan
Best of Luck.
Who will Elise and I argue with no? Keep in touch to let us know what's next.
Ems (Emma)"

"Dear Ryan,
Wishing you all the very best with your next adventure! It was lovely to work with you. Now put your shoes back on!
Elise"</blockquote>
<p>I look forward to catching up with these guys again in the coming weeks.</p>

<p>P.S. The shoes reference is I used to take my shoes off when it got really hot as I feel I work better without wearing sweaty shoes. I also used to walk 2km to work every day.</p>
