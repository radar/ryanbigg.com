          <p><strong>Please note: This is now <a href="http://github.com/radar/rboard">hosted at Github</a></strong>. <strong>Please use this page to get the latest changeset.</strong></p>

<p>As a result of Tom (0.01%) and mine’s (99.9%) work on-and-off for a few months, we’ve managed to <a href="http://code.google.com/p/railsforum/">get to a first release of Rails Forum</a>. The goal is to “be inspired by” and supercede PunBB and I think we’re almost there.</p>

<p>The PunBB about page states that:</p>
<blockquote>Some features that have so far not been implemented are:   private messaging, file attachments in posts, polls, linking to   off-site avatars, advanced text formatting controls, subforums   etc etc. Some of these features might still get implemented, just   not in the near future.</blockquote>
<p>We have private messaging, and we use Gravatar for our avatar system and we have subforums. There’s only three and a half things on that list (polls, real off-site avatars, adavanced text formatting controls and file attachments) that we have still to do. Polls are easy enough and probably my next goal, off-site avatars will be a bit tricky but I think we’ll manage and advanced text formatting controls are as easy as installing something like TinyMCE. File attachments can be done with attachment_fu.</p>

<p>What I would like to see is the whole site converted over to HAML as I enjoy working in it’s strictly tabbed environment and it’s just so much easier to read as you’re not reading what is basically the same thing twice. Another thing I would like to see is some bloody tests written for it! We were bad and only wrote a few tests. Pagination would be lovely too!</p>

<p>To run this forum system, you’ll need to download and extract it onto your computer. Then install Ruby and then Rubygems. After that, do</p>
<pre>gem install mongrel rails chronic RedCloth tzinfo</pre>
<p>To install mongrel and rails. Hopefully that’s all you’ll need.</p>
