            <p>I grow weary of you undercutting us honest workers in the web design industry and sending people who obviously do not know how to speak the English language into a primarily english based programming language. Perhaps, if you taught them how to speak the language the code is written in, then perhaps I would not be writing this blog post. I am not intending to be racist, but if it comes across that way I don't really care. I worked with two people from different regions of India for near-on 8 months and they were two of the smartest (and greatest) people I have ever met.</p>
<p>Your <s>slaves</s> workers come into #rubyonrails and ask in their distorted english extremely vague questions and expect us to help them with little or no clue as to what they're trying to do. Then when you ask them, it takes them forever to respond because they have to translate from their language, to ours. It is annoying and frankly I am no longer willing to put up with it. From now on anybody from India asking a question in #rubyonrails will be promptly placed on my ignore list unless they simply: 1) Ask in clear, concise English 2) Explain what their problem is rather than going &quot;can any1 hlp me plz????&quot;</p>
<p>What I am asking here is that before throwing them into the deep end of a programming language, teach them how to speak English (and not that shorthand crap either) and how to be polite and courteous and grateful for the <b>free</b> help we hand out on a daily basis in #rubyonrails. That's all, no strings attached. Simple.</p>
<p>Love,
Radar</p>
