          <p>Went to InLAN last night and it was great fun. Won the TF2 comp with Devastator, Insane Gazebo (aka Precious Pergola), Cadiniller and <a href="http://blog.thescream.org">TheScream</a>, came second in Warsow (even though Devastator was so confident that was his place) and won a door prize of about 500g worth of chocolate.</p>

<p>Upon driving home <a href="http://maps.google.com/?ie=UTF8&amp;ll=-34.799374,138.685559&amp;spn=0.00548,0.011373&amp;z=17">on The Golden Way</a>, during very light showers on slippery road, a stoned pedestrian decides it an appropriate time to step out onto the road. Not only was he now ON the road, but my car was also ON the road and in the same lane. A short fight ensued between a 1-ton 70-kilometer per hour moving vehicle and a 90kg pedestrian in which the pedestrian destroyed the car’s front grill, dented the bumper and bonnet, rolled up the bonnet and proceeded to smash the bottom left hand corner of the windshield before bouncing off the car and onto the road to lay unconcious. All the while, Devastator’s screaming and I’m not too calm myself. Police arrived, ambos and fire crew too. Statements, blood alcohol readings (negative) and drug tests (<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/radarlistener/2778743437/">negative also</a>) were taken. Hilarity did not ensue. It was cold. It was raining. It was not fun at all. I don’t recommend doing it. Pictures of my <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/radarlistener/sets/72157606637175442/">now not-so-sweet ride can be found here</a>.</p>

<p>Some more information is:</p>
<ul>
<li>The police were apparently looking for a guy matching his description. I was never told why. Something about a petrol station.</li>
<li>He was unconscious after I hit him and still when I dragged him (and I've been told I wasn't supposed to do that) but seemed to be regaining consciousness when he was lifted into the ambulance.</li>
<li>He probably has a collapsed lung due to the impact and possible broken ribs (yes, plural)</li>
<li>I heard over the police radio mention of marijuana in relation to the description of the guy</li>
<li>My dashboard is now loose on the right, but nothing a little glue can't hold still</li>
<li>I'm fine, Devastator sounded a bit shaky still this afternoon</li>
<li>Thank you for your concern, especially Dad who didn't hesitate to come out and pick me up that late at night.</li>
</ul>

<p>So, tomorrow I’m taking the day off work and taking the car to get repaired. During the time of the day that I’m not getting the car repaired I’ll probably working. On what, we’ll have to decide tomorrow.</p>
