          <p>So I have this friend who’s the same age as me. He doesn’t work. He doesn’t appear to be actively looking for work. He got “fired” from his last job because he wasn’t fast enough, but apparently the boss was an asshole. There was an excuse for the job before it too, but I can’t remember what that was. He’s constantly getting new things. I’d like to refer to him as a “super-consumer”, someone who has too much. He loves NERF and Transformers (keeping in mind he’s the same age as me). He’s never outwardly happy with the things he has, and is constantly in a “covet thy neighbour” state of mind (and he’s Christian!), always wanting the next level up as soon as it’s been released. Take for instance the graphics card I won at AsLAN in a silent auction. He asked me if <b>I</b> could put <b>my</b> brand new graphics card into <b>his</b> media center. His argument was for when he has movie nights, then I will appreciate the gift I gave unto him. Admittedly, it’s a card I have no use for, at the moment, but it’s always handy to have a spare in case things go wrong. So, rather than him actually putting the energy used into his craving for all that is new &amp; shiny into finding work so that he can buy all that is new &amp; shiny, he just craves. I think this path is going to destroy him, and there’s nothing I can do or say that will open his eyes to what he is bringing on himself.</p>
