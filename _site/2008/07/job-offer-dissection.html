          <p>I used to do these when I didn’t have a job, and since then I’ve been looking a lot less (read: not at all) for a new job. This, however, was accidentally clicked on in Apple Mail and I was tempted to dissect yet another one.</p>

<div class="quote">
From: ryanbrogan@gmail.com
</div>

<p>This is what made me cringe the most. If you’re a recruiter sending out recruitment emails, why do it from a gmail address? Why not use your own?</p>

<div class="quote">
One of my top clients and an incredible place to work...
</div>

<p>Who? It helps to list names. Names attract people. If I told you I was going to buy you a beer you’d get all excited. Then I would reveal it would be a Fosters, and you wouldn’t be so excited.</p>

<div class="quote">
secure two developers for staff positions paying 75-95k.
</div>

<p>With / without tax? Numbers are great, but more information is definitely needed here.</p>

<div class="quote">
Email me @ ryan [at] magnetagency.net
</div>

<p>Ah! There it is!</p>

<div class="quote"> or ryanbrogan [at] gmail.com</div>

<p>No really?</p>

<div class="quote">
1000.00 referral fee if someone you refer gets the position.
</div>
<p>Rupees? Zimbabwean Dollars? Kroner? Helps to specify a currency… but I guess American is inferred. Also, “fee”? Do we owe you money if we refer our friends to you?</p>

<div class="quote">
  We know you'd send your pals for free, but that's how we roll :)
</div>

<p>Ah, a smiley face. It makes me feel all warm and fuzzy. Also, respect goes out to the use of non-professional language here, makes it feel much better.</p>

<div class="quote">We have an aggressive product list comprised of social, personalization, user-generated, and content publishing features planned for the site
</div>

<p>“Aggressive product list”? What are we talking here? A few robberies with a weapon? Rape? Murder? Genocidal maniac?</p>

<div class="quote">
 and we're looking for a self-motivated developer to join the team.
</div>

<p>The team should motivate the developer, but it does help to be self-motivated too. Each member of the team should feed off each other’s energy.</p>

<div class="quote">
 If you're interested in working in a fast-paced,
</div>

<p>Running makes me sweaty. How fast are we talking?</p>

<div class="quote"> energetic environment </div>

<p>Pepsi Max and a proper sleep cycle gives me all the energy I need</p>

<div class="quote"> come work for us. </div>

<p>Rather not, I hear the commute from here to there is about 22 hours!</p>

Core Requirements:
</div>

<p>As compared to the other kind of requirements?</p>

<div class="quote">
* You're passionate about the craft of software engineering and love
building cool Web applications
</div>

<p>So, say, an aspiring Trolley Pusher wouldn’t be the right kind of person for this job then?</p>

<div class="quote">
* You're familiar with Test/Behavior Driven Development and agile
software development
</div>

<p>We spent long nights together in an orgy of code. There were files flying all over the place! A few commits took place, but nothing serious.</p>

<div class="quote">
* You have production Ruby on Rail experience
</div>

<p>Ruby’s going monorail now, huh?</p>

<div class="quote">including deployment</div>

<p>Inferred from last statement</p>

<div class="quote">with Mongrel</div>

<p>ditto</p>

<div class="quote">
* You're comfortable with semantic XHTML and CSS (not necessarily design)
</div>

<p>Uh oh, -1 point for chucking in “semantic” in there. Big words make people sad. “Well-structured” is what I would put there.</p>

<div class="quote">
* You're familiar with Javascript and AJAX
</div>

<p>I have nothing witty to say about this.</p>

<div class="quote">
* Ongoing application development
</div>

<p>Well, given that the position seems to be a Software Engineer-like position, this is pretty much a given. All application development is “ongoing”</p>

<div class="quote">
* Production support and ticket management
</div>

<p>Ah, so the position is now more of a Software Engineer meet Tech Support meet Project Manager position now? Cool. Probably a bit overwhelming for one person (we have this in three separate roles @ <a href="http://www.netfox.com">NetFox</a>)</p>

<div class="quote">
* Deployment management
</div>

<p>Easy enough with Capistrano, which most Ruby on Rails developers worth their salt should know.</p>

<p>Overall, a fairly good job advertisement. Still struggling to come up with a reason for posting from Gmail, but I’m sure there’s a fairly good one behind it. Thanks for not using buzzwords (apart from the iffy “semantic”)! It takes me so long to pick them all out and decipher them… I once saw “increases business continuity” <a href="http://websense.com">on a website</a> and I’m still trying to figure out what it means.</p>
