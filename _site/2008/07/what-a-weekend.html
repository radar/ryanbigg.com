          <p>And it hasn’t even begun!</p>

<p>Here I sit on a Friday night, on my bed with two quilts over the lower-half of my body. Sitting by the open window (yes, open. Even though it’s winter and 7.7 celcius outside) on my bed with my laptop on top of the quilts. My mum’s boyfriend’s son sits on the only chair in the room, using UberComputer and playing Spore Creature Creator, creating a dinosaur like creature. I feel relaxed, probably due to me getting off work a bit earlier than usual because the internet was balls (dialup had better ping times), and I know that there’s going to be a lot of stuff to do on the weekend.</p>

<p>Tomorrow I’m going to be attending <a href="http://avcon.org.au">AVCon</a>, not because I like dressing up in a Sailor Moon costume (not that I’m going to of course), I just want to see what all the fuss is about. Two of my friends (Brenton and James) have both recommended in one way or another that I go, so I’m going. Hopefully I’ll enjoy myself, but it is an <b>anime</b> andvideogames conference, and I’m not all that in to anime…</p>

<p>I’ve been tasked (is this the correct word?) to host Railscamp #4! I have an idea for a venue and I’m going to check it out on Sunday. Hopefully if all goes according to plan there should be a formal announcement soonish. Price and what not is not worked out yet, but I have a good idea and I’m not going to tell you! I’ll have a better idea Sunday night, if I can be bothered blogging about it.</p>

<p>See you on the other side!</p>

<p>EDIT: I didn’t go to AvCon (thanks for answering my calls James!), instead I scoped out the venue for Railscamp #4, went cruising with Devastator in the epic quest for computer parts and generally lazed about like all decent people [should] do on a weekend.</p>
