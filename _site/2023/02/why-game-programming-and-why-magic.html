          <p>For about the past 5 months, I’ve been fiddling with a little Ruby project called <a href="https://github.com/radar/mtg">“Magic: The Gathering: The Ruby Project”</a>. It’s my attempt to make Magic: The Gathering, in Ruby.</p>

<p>But why game programming when my forté is web programming, and why <em>this</em> game specifically?</p>

<p>Because I wanted a challenge!</p>

<p>I had played Magic first <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/magic-the-gathering-arena/id1496227521">through their Arena app on iOS</a>, which (mostly) works, save a few little issues here and there. Last year I started playing Magic weekly at a local game shop in town. I love the different mechanics of the different cards and figuring out how they all interact best. <em>Especially</em> when they syngerise together.</p>

<p>What’s appealing about this game is that while there’s a rulebook (I’ll get to that in a minute), the <em>cards themselves</em> make up the rules. If the creators want to change the rules of the game, they can print more cards with different text on them.</p>

<p>This is Rule 101.1 of Magic:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>101.1. Whenever a card’s text directly contradicts these rules, the card takes precedence.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Some of the cards are simple, like <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/a25/33/savannah-lions">Savannah Lions</a>. It costs one white mana to play, and it has 2 power and 1 toughness.</p>

<p>Others, like <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/eld/171/questing-beast">Questing Beast</a> with all its words, and <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/isd/181/garruk-relentless-garruk-the-veil-cursed">Garruk Relentless</a> with all its words on one side, <em>and then even more words on the other side</em>, are not so simple.</p>

<p>This Rule 101.1, the <em>first</em> of Magic’s several “Golden Rules”, is contained in <a href="https://media.wizards.com/2023/downloads/MagicCompRules%2020230203.pdf">this two-hundred-and-seventy-eight PDF page document</a>, where all of Magic’s non-card-defined rules are written down. Some of the rules even have examples with them.</p>

<p>If you wanted to find out all of the creature types, you’d look at Rule 205.3m.</p>

<p>Want to know how combat is designed to run? Start on page 74 with Rule 506, and finish on Page 84 with rule 511.</p>

<hr />

<p>Now this MTG-in-Ruby project is not a line-for-line reproduction of the rulebook or even a card-for-card replication attempt from A-Z. It started as an attempt to reproduce the features of a stack of random cards that were on my desk, and progressed from there to attempting to implement all of the <a href="https://scryfall.com/sets/m21?as=grid&amp;order=set">Core Set 2021</a> cards. I needed to set myself a goal, and even though that goal is <em>extremely ambitious</em>, it’s still a goal and something to aim for.</p>

<p>I’ve gotten most of the white cards done, and that leaves only about 300 more cards of that set. And <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Magic:_The_Gathering_sets">there are quite a few sets</a> .</p>

<p>What I’m particularly proud of here is that I have a clean DSL for being able to define cards and their abilities. For a simple card like <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/khm/34/story-seeker">Story Seeker</a>, I can define it like:</p>

<pre><code class="language-ruby">module Magic
  module Cards
    StorySeeker = Creature("Story Seeker") do
      cost generic: 1, white: 1
      type "Creature -- Dwarf Cleric"
      keywords :lifelink
      power 2
      toughness 2
    end
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>The one thing here I’d change is making those types into constants rather than being strings. I’ve been too lazy to address that yet, as it hasn’t been a problem. Here’s a quick riff on what that might look like:</p>

<pre><code class="language-ruby">module Magic
  module Cards
    StorySeeker = Creature("Story Seeker") do
      cost generic: 1, white: 1
      type Types::Creature[:Dwarf, :Cleric]
      keywords :lifelink
      power 2
      toughness 2
    end
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>While writing this post I built <a href="https://github.com/radar/mtg/commit/8cb9efe66248a1672d0e56a04bc8e92d19209385">this exact interface</a>. I’d love to go back to revisit it sometime to handle when an <em>invalid</em> type is passed, but it’ll work for the time-being.</p>

<hr />

<p>Another version of this DSL defines cards slightly differently, but provides some common method hooks for handling events and replacement effects. Here’s the card <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/m21/28/nine-lives">Nine Lives</a> that I’ve just implemented recently: <a href="https://github.com/radar/mtg/blob/master/lib/magic/cards/nine_lives.rb">https://github.com/radar/mtg/blob/master/lib/magic/cards/nine_lives.rb</a>.</p>
