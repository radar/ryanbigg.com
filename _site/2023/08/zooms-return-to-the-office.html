          <p>This news <a href="https://nypost.com/2023/08/05/zoom-tells-employees-to-return-to-office-for-work/">about Zoom forcing their employees back into the office for 2 days a week</a> is just bonkers.</p>

<p>For an Australian perspective:</p>

<p>In Melbourne, 50 miles would mean people on Phillip Island and Geelong would need to commute into the city, a 2 hour commute one way. Geelong people could take the V/Line, thankfully. Phillip Islanders are shit out of luck and would have to drive in.</p>

<p>In Sydney, 50 miles would mean people in Wentworth Falls, San Remo and Wollongong would also be forced to commute 2 hours into the office as well. Katoomba residents thank your lucky stars, you’re just outside of the magic number.</p>

<p>Two hour commutes! “Give up 8 hours of your week <em>in traffic</em> in the name of <em>synergy</em>.” What baloney.</p>

<hr />

<p>I really enjoy the flexibility of working from home. I can put on a load of washinxtg over my lunch break or potter around in the garden when the sun’s out. I can take the dog for a walk or a run to the park. I can take some time out at around 3 and collect my daughter from school without having to commute first back to home and then out again to the school.</p>

<p>Environmentally: I can control the temperature in my office. There’s nobody walking around behind my monitor or talking loudly on their phone nearby. I have control over my desk and I can set it up however I like without some HR person mandating that I’m sharing it with someone due to space reasons.</p>

<p>And for all of these reasons, I’m a happy employee. I get my work done, and <em>more of it</em>, because I can choose the conditions in how that work is done. And if I need to <em>synergise</em> with another employee, why there’s Zoom for that.</p>
