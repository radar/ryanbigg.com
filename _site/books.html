    Here are the books that I have written. I write books so that everyone can learn from what I know and so that other
    people don't have to write them.

      <p class="text-xl">
        This book is about how we can approach building a frontend application using a combination of React, Next.JS,
        TypeScript, GraphQL, Apollo, and GraphQL Code Generator. These tools are a winning combination for a frontend
        stack.

      <p class="text-xl">

        Joy of Elixir is a gentle introduction to programming, aimed at people who already know some things about
        computers.
      </p>

      <p>
        This book will teach you the core concepts of the Elixir programming language in a fun and enjoyable way. If
        you're completely new to programming and you want to learn how to make a computer do things using the power of
        programming and you want to experience some joy while doing it, then read this book.

      <p class="text-xl"><a href='https://activerailsbook.com'>Active Rails</a> guides you through building a
        fully-featured Rails 6 application, teaching you best practices about Behaviour-Driven-Development along the

      <p class="text-xl">
        <a href='http://leanpub.com/multi-tenancy-rails-2'>Multitenancy with Rails</a> teaches you super neat tricks
        about Ruby, Rails and PostgreSQL while you build a multi-tenanted, Software as a Service, Ruby on Rails
        application. Works on Rails 4 and up.
      </p>

      <p>
        This book is what I'd consider an "intermediate" Rails book. It's something that you would read after finishing
        Rails 4 in Action, so in a way Multitenancy is a sequel to Rails 4 in Action.
      </p>

      <p>
        This book uses <a href='https://github.com/radar/twist'>Twist</a> -- an app I wrote from scratch -- as the basis
        for the work done in the book.

        Have you felt the pain of using Active Record on a large codebase? How about messy controllers? Read this short
        guide on how to improve a Rails application's structure by exploding its responsibilities into small classes
        with their own unique responsibilities. Starring rom-rb and dry-rb.
      </p>

      <p>
        I wrote this book on the back of my near decade-long experience with Rails and it was a really fun experience to
        work out how to build a Rails app without Active Record. I hope others find it just as fun too. Maybe this book
        will start a movement?
