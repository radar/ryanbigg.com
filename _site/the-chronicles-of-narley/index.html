<pre><code>[03:03] &lt;unthinkingly&gt; Narley: If you need help with an error, we need to see the code that created the error as well as the error, if that makes sense
[03:03] &lt;Narley&gt; you guys are gonna steal it from me

[12:27] &lt;Narley&gt; ?
[12:30] &lt;Geffy&gt; Narley: check out the advanced rails recipes book, think its got some details on that
[12:31] &lt;Narley&gt; they want 40 Dollars for that book!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
[12:32] &lt;rsl&gt; Narley: if learning rails isn't worth 40 bucks. :/
[12:32] &lt;Narley&gt; ill get it im just saying
[12:32] &lt;zubin&gt; Narley: yeah, it's a hell of a deal! :)
[12:32] &lt;rsl&gt; and 40 bucks isn't even a lot.
[12:32] &lt;Narley&gt; 40 dollars!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

<pre><code>[20:50] &lt;Narley&gt; anyone here have advanced rails recipes?
[20:50] &lt;Quastor&gt; got it yesterday
[20:51] &lt;Narley&gt; ok
[20:51] &lt;Narley&gt; have you looked at the Subdomain recipe
[20:51] &lt;Narley&gt; i just bought the pdf today
[20:52] &lt;Quastor&gt; not yet but the book is in front of me
[20:52] &lt;Narley&gt; bah
[20:52] &lt;Narley&gt; the subdomain recipe aint workin
[20:53] &lt;Radar&gt; Narley: yes indeed I have that book.
[20:53] &lt;Radar&gt; It's on my desk.
[20:53] &lt;Radar&gt; At work.
[20:54] &lt;Radar&gt; Define how it isn't working.
[20:56] &lt;Narley&gt; Radar
[20:56] &lt;Narley&gt; like for instance
[20:56] &lt;Narley&gt; when i make a user account from my code
[20:56] &lt;Narley&gt; i want it to automatically route to subdomain
[20:56] &lt;Narley&gt; i do that
[20:56] &lt;Narley&gt; and it dont work
[20:56] &lt;Narley&gt; peace of shit boook
[20:56] &lt;Narley&gt; i got ripped off
[20:57] &lt;Narley&gt; is thier any way i can return it?
[20:57] &lt;Radar&gt; Narley: what version of rails are you using?
[20:57] &lt;Narley&gt; 2.1
[20:57] &lt;Narley&gt; the latest and greatest
[20:57] &lt;Quastor&gt; is your DNS set correctly?
[20:58] &lt;Narley&gt; Dynamic Naming Server?
[20:58] &lt;Narley&gt; it did mention something about it
[20:58] &lt;Narley&gt; where do i fix that stuff at?
[20:58] &lt;Quastor&gt; -_- so you complain about the book but skip over steps
[20:59] &lt;Narley&gt; it didnt give me anything or tell me where to edit DNS
[20:59] &lt;Narley&gt; i think its a book bug?
[20:59] &lt;Quastor&gt; no
[20:59] &lt;Radar&gt; Sick 'im Quastor.
[21:00] &lt;Quastor&gt; you'd alter the DNS with whoever you have your domain set up with
[21:00] &lt;Radar&gt; Or you edit your /etc/hosts file.
[21:00] &lt;Narley&gt; ok
[21:01] &lt;workdammit&gt; i'm in your dns server, poisoning it
[21:01] &lt;Narley&gt; so like on 37signals thiers a guy who edits the host file on the server maually for every new account?

You have a nil object when you didn't expect it!

<pre><code>[14:06] &lt;Narley&gt; guys
[14:06] &lt;Narley&gt; got to my application please
[14:06] &lt;Narley&gt; localhost:3000
[14:06] &lt;Narley&gt; test it out
[14:07] &lt;Narley&gt; tell me what you think
[14:07] &lt;Narley&gt; http://localhost:3000
[14:07] &lt;Narley&gt; what you mean
[14:07] &lt;ReinH&gt; Narley: ?
[14:08] &lt;ReinH&gt; Narley: I mean that we can't see your localhost
[14:08] &lt;ReinH&gt; only you can
[14:08] &lt;Narley&gt; why not?
[14:08] &lt;Quastor&gt; localhost is well, local
[14:08] &lt;ReinH&gt; Narley: do you know what localhost means?
[14:08] &lt;Narley&gt; no
[14:08] &lt;ReinH&gt; if not, you should look it up.
[14:08] &lt;Narley&gt; ok
[14:09] &lt;ReinH&gt; http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;amp;q=localhost&amp;amp;btnG=Google+Search
[14:09] &lt;Narley&gt; i thought mongrel was localhost?
[14:09] &lt;radarek&gt; maybe Narley has external IP?;-)
[14:09] &lt;ReinH&gt; radarek: doesn't matter lol
[14:09] &lt;ReinH&gt; localhost is still localhost
[14:09] &lt;ReinH&gt; if he has an externam IP, he can give us that link
[14:09] &lt;ReinH&gt; *external
[14:09] &lt;radarek&gt; ReinH: I know, but maybe he can give us his external IP ;)
[14:10] &lt;radarek&gt; ReinH: I know what 'localhost' means :)
[14:10] &lt;Quastor&gt; and this is the guy who was trolling people yesterday about being a great PHP dev, no? =P
[14:10] &lt;ReinH&gt; I wouldn't count on it
[14:10] &lt;universa1&gt; radarek: don't play with the little children ;)
[14:12] &lt;Narley&gt; i dont get this localhost buisness
[14:12] &lt;radarek&gt; Narley: for everybody 'localhost' means 'my computer'
[14:12] &lt;Narley&gt; so that means my internet host is locally near my computer?
[14:13] &lt;nice_burger&gt; Narley: you're putting us on right?
[14:13] &lt;Quastor&gt; it means when your ethernet card gets a request for "localhost", it just sends it to itself
[14:13] &lt;radarek&gt; Narley: it means that we can't get to your computer by 'localhost' address
[14:13] &lt;ReinH&gt; Narley: you can't be serious
[14:13] &lt;Narley&gt; even though there are no hosting companies near my house?
[14:13] &lt;ReinH&gt; Narley: did you read the wikipedia post?
[14:14] &lt;Narley&gt; not yet
[14:14] &lt;ReinH&gt; Narley: then why are you asking us?
[14:14] &lt;ReinH&gt; read it
[14:14] &lt;Narley&gt; ok
[14:14] &lt;ReinH&gt; "I don't understand this thing." "Did you try to understand it?" "No."
[14:14] &lt;ReinH&gt; *facepalm*
[14:15] &lt;Narley&gt; pretty much when you sign up for internet
[14:15] &lt;Narley&gt; your isp gives you a localhost
[14:16] &lt;Narley&gt; with them
[14:16] &lt;nice_burger&gt; Narley: nope, not close
[14:16] &lt;Narley&gt; so you can test things locally
[14:16] &lt;toretore&gt; lol
[14:16] &lt;nice_burger&gt; localhost works even without being connected to the outside world
[14:16] &lt;Quastor&gt; ._.
[14:16] &lt;ReinH&gt; Narley: nope
[14:16] &lt;leethal&gt; There's no place like 127.0.0.1
[14:18] &lt;Narley&gt; ok
[14:18] &lt;Narley&gt; wait
[14:18] &lt;Narley&gt; im wireless
[14:18] &lt;Narley&gt; so my isp still would have control
[14:18] &lt;ReinH&gt; Ah, then disable your wireless
[14:18] &lt;Quastor&gt; disable your wireless
[14:19] &lt;nice_burger&gt; Narley: can disable wireless permanantly for us a sec?
[14:19] &lt;Narley&gt; ok i try it
[14:19] &lt;nice_burger&gt; ok, let us know
[14:20] &lt;Narley&gt; it didnt work
[14:20] &lt;Narley&gt; said it couldnt connect
[14:21] &lt;Narley&gt; i dont have a tv near my router
[14:21] &lt;Narley&gt; my router provides me internet
[14:21] &lt;Narley&gt; i dont have a tv near my router
[14:21] &lt;Narley&gt; my router provides me internet

[14:21] &lt;ReinH&gt; nothing to see here, people
[14:22] Narley (n=chatzill@c-68-62-58-132.hsd1.mi.comcast.net) joined #rubyonrails.

[13:10] &lt;octoberdan&gt; yeah?
[13:10] &lt;Narley&gt; is there a gem or something to that nature
[13:19] &lt;Narley&gt; DUDE
[13:20] &lt;Narley&gt; im trying to do it like facebook kinda
[13:20] &lt;Narley&gt; -_-
[13:20] &lt;Narley&gt; i have this app
[13:20] &lt;Narley&gt; and many people can be doing something in the app
[13:20] &lt;Narley&gt; they need some real time communication
[13:20] &lt;Narley&gt; CHAT
[13:20] &lt;dirtyhand&gt; DANC
[13:20] &lt;Narley&gt; individualy
[13:20] &lt;Narley&gt; I want CHAT
[13:21] &lt;Narley&gt; ook
[13:21] &lt;dfr|work&gt; well what _is_ chat?
[13:21] &lt;Narley&gt; like IM almost
[13:22] &lt;Narley&gt; so make a messageing system
[13:22] &lt;Narley&gt; that updates real time
[13:22] &lt;dfr|work&gt; pretty much, yes.
[13:22] &lt;dfr|work&gt; not real time.
[13:22] &lt;dfr|work&gt; you can't update things in HTTP
[13:22] &lt;Narley&gt; bah
[13:22] &lt;dfr|work&gt; since request needs to originate from user
[13:22] &lt;dfr|work&gt; server can't really update things.. unless you resort to hacks
[13:22] &lt;Narley&gt; So rails is not capable of doing chat
[13:22] &lt;Narley&gt; DAMMIT
[13:22] &lt;dfr|work&gt; HTTP is not capable
[13:22] &lt;Narley&gt; i knew i shoulda stuck with PHP
[13:33] &lt;Narley&gt; well
[13:33] &lt;Narley&gt; back to PHP with me
[13:33] &lt;dfr|work&gt; Narley, php won't help you. it's an http thing.
[13:35] &lt;nice_burger&gt; coulda sworn Narley was banned yesterday
[13:35] &lt;Narley&gt; hacks
[13:35] &lt;Narley&gt; and pursuasive talking
[13:35] &lt;Narley&gt; i know the admins personally
[13:35] &lt;Narley&gt; so
[13:35] &lt;donomo&gt; nice_burger: give it 5 more minutes.. :)
[13:35] &lt;nice_burger&gt; but today he's being so reasonable. maybe this is the real Narley and yesterday was his little sister
[13:35] &lt;JamesKilton&gt; Narley: I think you need to spend some time understanding what Chat is, what HTTP and how the web works, before trying to make a chat program
[13:35] &lt;Narley&gt; stfu burger boy
[13:36] &lt;ncancelliere&gt; i love /ignore all :-)
[13:36] &lt;nice_burger&gt; stfu?

[13:37] &lt;Narley&gt; i was joking
[13:42] &lt;Narley&gt; nice_burger i was joking earlier
[13:42] &lt;Narley&gt; please forgive me
[13:43] &lt;nice_burger&gt; Narley: don't know to what you refer

[13:44] &lt;Narley&gt; &lt;Narley&gt;   James
[13:44] &lt;Narley&gt; &lt;Narley&gt;   I think its an Ajax thing
[13:44] &lt;Narley&gt; &lt;Narley&gt;   but ill read up on it
[13:44] &lt;Narley&gt; &lt;JamesKilton&gt;  Ajax is a way you can implement it, yes
[13:44] &lt;Narley&gt; &lt;dfr|work&gt; ncancelliere, you can set the attributes to be "" in migration. Or you can override the accessor to return "" if nil... but not sure if that'll help you much.
[13:44] &lt;nice_burger&gt; christ
[13:44] &lt;Narley&gt; &lt;dfr|work&gt; ncancelliere, 'cause you'll have to check if it's "" then
[13:44] &lt;Narley&gt; &lt;Narley&gt;   Nice Burger
[13:44] &lt;Narley&gt; &lt;Narley&gt;   i was joking

[18:10] &lt;Narley&gt; look
[18:10] &lt;Narley&gt; is rails bugged?
[18:10] &lt;rsl&gt; http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/001079.html no
[18:10] &lt;rsl&gt; yr code is just borked and i can't tell anything meaningful about it from that pastie.
[18:11] &lt;rsl&gt; i think you are using params[:something] as a number when it's a string though.
[18:11] &lt;rsl&gt; params[:whatever].to_i
[18:11] &lt;rsl&gt; just a guess
[18:11] &lt;Narley&gt; wanna see the dashboard code

[15:26] &lt;d0inks&gt; i was fucked up that day i was talking about symbols
[15:27] &lt;d0inks&gt; cakephp
[15:27] &lt;d0inks&gt; just got scaffolding
[15:27] &lt;d0inks&gt; i hear its pretty neat -_-
[15:28] &lt;d0inks&gt; in cakephp you have to say wiodnaodnadionionwfioandaodnaod/scaffold/rescaffold/mydir/scafffold this/ my new drive dir/ scaffold/ more commands commands commands commands
[15:28] &lt;context&gt; wtf
[15:28] &lt;rsl&gt; lol
[15:28] &lt;d0inks&gt; very conventional
[15:28] &lt;context&gt; we really dont care about cakephp to be honest :X
[15:28] &lt;stocke2&gt; d0inks: why the hell would you scaffold then, seems like more work than doing it all manually
[15:29] &lt;d0inks&gt; to save time?
[15:29] &lt;rsl&gt; lol

[12:55] &lt;d0inks&gt; i been trying to tell every one that the svn link is not workin
[12:55] &lt;pyroblue&gt; d0inks: i got MCE installed yesterday with no worries, and without coming in here and demanding like a schmuck --
[12:55] &lt;Anthro&gt; d0inks: Well, the first time you tried it you used http instead of https.
[12:55] &lt;pyroblue&gt; d0inks: ill be glad to help -- just chill mang.
[12:55] &lt;context&gt; if they are both singleton
[12:55] &lt;d0inks&gt; aight
[12:56] &lt;d0inks&gt; sorry about the attitude guys
[12:56] &lt;Anthro&gt; d0inks: The subsequent times you tried you used https, but tried to external it in when your project isn't in subversion.
[12:56] &lt;Anthro&gt; d0inks: So use the https URL and skip the -x
[12:57] &lt;d0inks&gt; I GOT IT

[21:41] &lt;d0inks&gt; ok
[21:41] &lt;fowlduck&gt; or there's another one..i forget

[21:42] &lt;fowlduck&gt; d0inks: easy way - write one
[21:42] &lt;fowlduck&gt; :)
[21:43] &lt;Radar&gt; Or you could integrate your app into a forum
[21:50] &lt;d0inks&gt; how would that work lol?
[21:51] &lt;Radar&gt; have an existing forum system and build your app around it
[21:52] &lt;d0inks&gt; NO
[21:52] &lt;d0inks&gt; thats what PHP coders do
[21:52] &lt;d0inks&gt; i build from scratch

&lt;d0inks&gt; anyone know of a good forum plugin for rails?
&lt;fowlduck&gt; plugin? no
&lt;fowlduck&gt; but check out altered beast
&lt;d0inks&gt; ok
&lt;fowlduck&gt; or there's another one..i forget
&lt;d0inks&gt; cause i was trying to find a way to integrate a forum into my app
&lt;fowlduck&gt; also, look here: http://www.opensourcerails.com/
&lt;fowlduck&gt; d0inks: easy way - write one
&lt;fowlduck&gt; :)
&lt;Radar&gt; Or you could integrate your app into a forum
&lt;d0inks&gt; NO
&lt;d0inks&gt; thats what PHP coders do
&lt;d0inks&gt; i build from scratch
&lt;d0inks&gt; just like david
&lt;d0inks&gt; hiensmann

[16:56] &lt;Radar&gt; AHA!!
[16:56] &lt;jereme&gt; !!!
[16:56] &lt;Radar&gt; jereme: remember Ruddly? He was also d0inks
[16:56] &lt;jereme&gt; hey he's one of the top ones
[16:56] &lt;jereme&gt; btw, I read Narley for awhile
[16:56] &lt;jereme&gt; super entertaining
[16:56] &lt;Radar&gt; yup
[16:57] &lt;d0inks&gt; shut up both of you
[16:57] &lt;d0inks&gt; im learning rails
[16:57] &lt;-- Vegasmac has left this server (Read error: 110 (Connection timed out)).
[16:57] &lt;-- Sarotti has left this server (Read error: 110 (Connection timed out)).
[16:57] &lt;jereme&gt; good good
[16:57] &lt;jereme&gt; from scratch
[16:57] &lt;d0inks&gt; yeah
[16:57] &lt;nemlet&gt; I think I can get around this by making Order_ref be the primary key, however we have a rather complex method of figuring out what the next primary key is going to be (a space saving method of filling in previously deleted blocks) so is there a way I can override ActiveRecords method of assinging a new primary key?
[16:57] &lt;jereme&gt; just like david hiensmann
[16:57] &lt;Radar&gt; I merged the two
[16:57] &lt;Radar&gt; http://twonklist.com/twonks/24
[16:57] &lt;d0inks&gt; i kinda just dove write in
[16:58] &lt;d0inks&gt; start tweaking with code
[16:58] &lt;d0inks&gt; not know what did what
[16:58] &lt;d0inks&gt; now im learning about MVC
[16:58] &lt;d0inks&gt; quite efficient
[16:58] &lt;d0inks&gt; and how to apply symbols
[16:58] &lt;d0inks&gt; to a user
[16:58] &lt;jereme&gt; understanding MVC and ruby are definitely cornerstones to your learning experience
[16:58] &lt;d0inks&gt; before learning MVC
[16:59] &lt;d0inks&gt; i didnt know wtf was going on
[16:59] &lt;-- Aaaarg_ has left this server (Read error: 110 (Connection timed out)).
[16:59] &lt;d0inks&gt; i was putting controller code in views
[16:59] --&gt; arooni_____ has joined this channel (n=arooni__@c-67-168-26-198.hsd1.wa.comcast.net).
[16:59] &lt;d0inks&gt; and view code in models
[16:59] &lt;d0inks&gt; and model code in controllers
[16:59] --&gt; collink has joined this channel (n=collin@adsl-163-48-72.hsv.bellsouth.net).
[16:59] &lt;-- sudothinker has left this server.
[16:59] &lt;d0inks&gt; fucking with routes and putting them in eviroment.rb
[16:59] &lt;jereme&gt; what were you putting in the helpers?
[16:59] &lt;joelmichael&gt; fixtures
[16:59] &lt;jereme&gt; no need to swear
[17:00] &lt;d0inks&gt; i put some migration code in the helpers
[17:00] &lt;jereme&gt; ......
[17:00] &lt;d0inks&gt; i never even got a chance to see my app render on screen
[17:00] &lt;d0inks&gt; i kept seeing error screens instead
[17:00] &lt;-&gt; Radar&gt; wow this guy is full of shit
[17:00] &lt;d0inks&gt; every time i thought i fixed an error
[17:00] &lt;d0inks&gt; another one came up
[17:00] &lt;d0inks&gt; reminded me og m php days
[17:01] &lt;-- priidu has left this server (Read error: 110 (Connection timed out)).
[17:01] &lt;d0inks&gt; where MVC was pointless
[17:01] &lt;jereme&gt; mvc is never pointless
[17:01] &lt;-- lightnote has left this server.
[17:01] &lt;jereme&gt; php is pointless, not mvc
[17:01] &lt;d0inks&gt; i just hope that rails can survice and Microsoft takeover
[17:01] &lt;jereme&gt; that's what it stands for... Pointless Hypertext Processor
[17:02] &lt;jereme&gt; you hope that microsoft takes over rails?
[17:02] &lt;d0inks&gt; an*
[17:02] &lt;d0inks&gt; well
[17:02] &lt;d0inks&gt; think about it
[17:02] &lt;d0inks&gt; rails.net
[17:02] &lt;d0inks&gt; being able to interlope
[17:02] &lt;jereme&gt; it's called Iron Ruby
[17:02] &lt;d0inks&gt; C# CODE AND RAILS
[17:02] &lt;jereme&gt; it already exists
[17:02] &lt;d0inks&gt; and vb.net
[17:02] &lt;d0inks&gt; no
[17:02] &lt;jereme&gt; and rails doesn't need any part of it
[17:02] &lt;d0inks&gt; I mean RAILS.NET
[17:02] &lt;fowlduck&gt; they're making it
[17:02] &lt;fowlduck&gt; relax
[17:02] &lt;fowlduck&gt; stop smokin the pot
[17:03] &lt;fowlduck&gt; plz
