title: 3 Years at Fat Zebra
published: false
---

A few weeks ago I celebrated 3 years at [Fat Zebra](https://fatzebra.com), a payments service provider. I still don't fully understand why its name is that.

I chose to work full-time after experiencing the loneliness of being a contractor. I wrote a lot about this in my [Culture and Values](https://ryanbigg.com/2021/12/culture-and-values). I was hired at Fat Zebra for my Ruby skills, and [demoed my book review app](https://ryanbigg.com/2021/08/a-tour-of-twist) as a part of the interview.

I document a lot of what I've done over on my [/work](/work) tab. A surprisingly large chunk of that work has nothing to do with what I demoed during the interview. Instead, I've become the de facto Frontend Tech Lead by being the Rubyist that hates JavaScript the least. It honestly isn't that bad and I think a lot of the hate coming from Rubyists / other backenders is due to a collective trauma of churn from about a decade ago. It's a lot more stable these days.

Since I started, the team has gone from just me and a designer to now a team of four developers and a new product manager / designer. Out of those developers, two joined the team as junior developers (in different years) and we've spent a lot of time training them up and they're now confident and capable developers. I trade my arcane backend Ruby knowledge for their arcane frontend knowledge. We compliment each other's strengths and weaknesses; I trade arcane Ruby knowledge for their frontend knowledge.

We've introduced a design system to standardize on the look and feel of the applications we maintain. This is using a lot of React componentry and I keep wondering if we could swap over to Web Components instead. Perhaps one day.
