title: "Lead Engineer: The Advocate"

Since April I've been on a migration project at Fat Zebra, working on integrating two different payment systems together into one unified whole. It's been an interesting journey and knowing who I am, I will probably write a book (ala [The Phoenix Project](https://www.amazon.com.au/Phoenix-Project-DevOps-Helping-Business/dp/0988262592)) about this once it's done and dusted.

Outside of that project, I am still a Lead Developer for the Customer Experience team, a team of Rubyists + frontenders building the pretty face of Fat Zebra. Whatever a merchant sees with their eyeballs, we own. Near enough.

One big thing that I do as a Lead is be an advocate for my team, its people and its processes.

What this typically means day-to-day is being the person who is the least confused about Ruby most of the time (a "subject-matter expert"), or at least someone who can sympathetically head-tilt while we puzzle through something together on a Zoom call. I know the ancient lore why things were done a certain way and can help provide guidance on that front. This is inward-facing, and is focussing my efforts on helping the team understand the technology that we have to build and maintain to progress things along.

As a part of that effort, I try to share my knowledge out to the rest of the team, and absorb their knowledge they've got too, so that we can distribute the load of the work between all of us. I think Fat Zebra has, by about 2 years, grown out of the time where the company needs a Rockstar/Cowboy Developer who can just smash code out relentlessly. The kind of developer who will always be the first to jump in to solve an issue. Now we do that together as a team whenever that comes up.

I tend to use the analogy of an orchestra a lot when describing the team. Each of us are capable in different ways, but together we can make some really great things. No one person is greater than the whole.

Still inwardly facing, another thing I spend my time on is mentoring developers in our 1-on-1 sessions. These are usually half-an-hour long but can run on sometimes, and are unblockable by other things. Regardless of how busy I am, I feel it's imperative I have these meetings.

In these sessions, we cover off whatever's on their agenda which typically ends up being about the work that they've done this week. That then falls into technical advice where we bounce ideas around. Then I sometimes send them away with "homework" to do, which we talk about in the next 1-on-1 as usually the first agenda item of mine.

Sometimes the 1-on-1s are career-focussed, such as discussions around where I'd rank them along a sliding scale between Junior and Lead. I can find these hard to judge, as there are many different ways that someone can demonstrate qualities of a Mid, Senior or Lead, and "performance" can vary based on environmental or personal factors. Two people who share the same title can have earned that title through vastly different means. When I see qualities being demonstrated outside of their current role, I try to make a point in calling that out. A recent example was: "8 weeks ago, you wouldn't have done that so easily".

I track notes about these 1-on-1s in password-protected files, splitting my screen between a video of the person and their relative notes. It'll include small phrases of what we talked about as a reminder of talking points, "homework assignments" and any work of theirs that I found notable since the last time we talked. I track the work this way as a way of compiling a list that I can take to my managers to argue for promotions or salary boosts. I would like to work on a more structured company-wide version of this, as it feels ad-hoc at the moment.

Outwardly facing now, my third major bit of advocacy is liaising with the other teams in the business.




1. Outward-facing advocacy

Go deeper into what “liaising with other teams” looks like in practice.

How do you make sure Customer Experience’s needs are represented in cross-team decisions?

What kinds of conflicts or trade-offs come up between teams (e.g. platform priorities vs. merchant UX), and how do you handle them?

Do you ever act as a translator between technical and non-technical groups?

2. The glue work of leadership

Talk about the “invisible” parts of leadership that don’t show up on a sprint board but keep the team functioning.

Setting context before planning.

Shielding the team from unnecessary churn.

Noticing when morale dips and taking action.

Maybe reflect on how this “glue work” differs from the hands-on coding you used to do, and how you balance both.

3. Growing into advocacy

How your view of leadership has shifted over time (from “just write code” to “make space for others”).

Any mistakes you made early on in this role (like being too protective, not protective enough, over-indexing on code reviews, etc.) and what you’ve learned.

4. Sustainability and scaling

The danger of being the “single throat to choke” vs. empowering your team to advocate for themselves.

How you try to avoid becoming a bottleneck while still being the team’s representative voice.

What you do when you’re unavailable — how do you make sure advocacy doesn’t stop with you?

5. Personal practices

Tools or rituals you use to stay effective: note-taking systems (you mentioned), calendars, making space for “deep listening,” etc.

How you manage context switching between inward (team mentoring) and outward (cross-team diplomacy) modes.

6. The emotional side

How it feels to carry the responsibility of being a team’s advocate.

Balancing empathy for your team with tough conversations when trade-offs are unavoidable.

The difference between being “nice” and being an effective advocate.

7. Closing reflection

What you hope your team would say about you as their advocate.

The legacy you want to leave in this role — not just projects shipped, but how people felt supported and grew under your watch.

Would you like me to sketch an extra outward-facing section for you (parallel to the inward-facing ones you already have), so the post feels more balanced?
