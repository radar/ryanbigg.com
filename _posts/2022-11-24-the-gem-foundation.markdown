<div class="text-3xl text-center"><p>Today, I am excited to announce the launch of <strong>The Gem Foundation</strong>.</p></div>

Its mission is assist contributors in the Ruby community in their task to further the adoption of the Ruby language, expanding the scope more broadly than just one particular web framework.

Because Ruby _is_ more than just a single framework.

Immediately after establishment of this foundation, we have already surpassed [The Rails Foundation](https://rubyonrails.org/2022/11/14/the-rails-foundation) in terms of dollars donated, as we have donated **ONE SINGLE U.S. DOLLAR** to [Brandon Weaver](https://ruby.social/@baweaver), who was the first developer to get in touch with the foundation. Brandon contributes to the Ruby community by [writing articles on his personal blog](https://dev.to/baweaver), and also runs the Ruby Learning Center Discord.

The Gem Foundation has also donated **TWO U.S. DOLLARS** to [Jared White](https://ruby.social/@jaredwhite@indieweb.social), who is a contributor to [the Bridgetown](https://www.bridgetownrb.com/) site generator.

The Gem Foundation is also contributing $25/USD a month towards the [Hanami](https://github.com/sponsors/hanami) web framework. If you would like there to be real competition in the Ruby web framework sphere, I would encourage you to do the same.

That's _$28USD_ already donated by the Gem Foundation!

**UPDATE**: Kieran Andrews from Adelaide (and of [Active Rails fame](https://activerailsbook.com)) has also donated _$30USD_ to the [Pry gem](https://github.com/pry/pry), bringing The Gem Foundation's donation total up to $58USD!

**UPDATE #2**: As it's now the 1st of December, a payment of $35USD has been made to the Hanami organisation on GitHub. This brings our total donations almost to $100!

We have also donated $75 to other members of the Ruby community for their work on open source projects, with a remaining $125 "prize pool" for further pull requests for code or documentation work. This brings our total of donations up to $318.
