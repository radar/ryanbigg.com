<div class="text-3xl text-center"><p>Today, I am excited to announce the launch of <strong>The Gem Foundation</strong>.</p></div>

Its mission is assist contributors in the Ruby community in their task to further the adoption of the Ruby language, expanding the scope more broadly than just one particular web framework.

Because Ruby _is_ more than just a single framework.

Immediately after establishment of this foundation, we have already surpassed [The Rails Foundation](https://rubyonrails.org/2022/11/14/the-rails-foundation) in terms of dollars donated, as we have donated **ONE SINGLE U.S. DOLLAR** to [Brandon Weaver](https://ruby.social/@baweaver), who was the first developer to get in touch with the foundation. Brandon contributes to the Ruby community by [writing articles on his personal blog](https://dev.to/baweaver), and also runs the Ruby Learning Center Discord.

The Gem Foundation is also contributing $25/USD a month towards the [Hanami](https://github.com/sponsors/hanami) web framework. If you would like there to be real competition in the Ruby web framework sphere, I would encourage you to do the same.

That's _$26USD_ already donated by the Gem Foundation!
