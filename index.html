<h1>Hi! I'm Ryan!</h1>

<!-- <p class="large">I absolutely love <a href="/mentoring">mentoring developers</a> and would love to mentor you too. Get in touch.</p> -->

<p class="x-large">
  I wrote <a href="/books">the books</a> and <a href='http://guides.rubyonrails.org'>guides</a> that your developers
  read.
</p>

<p class='large'>
  There's a high chance I've <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/15245/ryan-bigg">answered their questions on
    Stack Overflow</a> too.
</p>

<p class="large">I pay the bills through consultancy work, developing people (and apps!) in exchange for money.</p>

<p class="large">
  If you want to contact me about working together, <a href="/work">go here first</a>.
</p>

  If you're interested, you can <a href="/now">see what I'm doing now</a>.
