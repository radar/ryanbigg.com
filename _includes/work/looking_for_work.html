    <h2>I am currently looking for my next contract gig.</h2>

    <p class="text-xl">
      My current contract is with <a href='https://oculo.com.au'>Oculo</a> on a two-person team building and maintaining
      <a href='https://keepsight.org.au/'>keepsight.org.au</a>. This project aims to remind people with diabetes in
      Australia to get regular eye tests to prevent vision loss. This is a Ruby on Rails application with a frontend
      primarily built in Tailwind, React and TypeScript.
    </p>

    <p class="text-xl">
      The second part of this contract is helping Oculo build a subscription billing system with Stripe to replace a
      manual billing process for the users of their application.
    </p>

    <p class="text-xl">
      This contract is wrapping up on the <span class="highlight">6th August</span>, and I'll be looking for work to
      <span class="highlight">start 9th August</span> or
      very soon after. I'm available for <span class="highlight">up to 4 days a week</span>.
    </p>

    <p class="text-xl">I can only work <span class="highlight">remotely</span> from Warrnambool, Australia. Due to family
      commitments here, I cannot commute to anywhere else.</p>

    <h3>Work exclusions</h3>

    <p>
      Having no particular allegiance to an industry makes it particularly hard to choose where to go next. However,
      there's some places I could exclude right off the bat due to my preferences:
    </p>

    <ul class="mt-4">
      <li>- Cryptocurrency - Fancy ponzi scheme that does nothing good for the world</li>
      <li>- Advertising / marketing — slimy.</li>
      <li>- Betting / Gambling — I don't like gaming other people's addictive behaviours.</li>
      <li>- Smoking / Vaping — I find smoking in all forms extremely anti-social.</li>
      <li>- Real Estate - I've had enough dealings with real estate agents, thank you.</li>
      <li>- Working on an entire team with people like me (white, straight, male)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Please do not contact me about jobs in these industries.

    <h2>My Ideal Role</h2>

    <p class="text-xl">
      Working on a team where I can mentor and grow the developers around me while we build applications is <em>my
        zone</em>.
    </p>

    <p class="text-xl">
      While it's all fun and good to write the code <em>myself</em>, I definitely prefer doing that while helping
      upskill people around me. Be that through pair programming, writing technical documentation or reviewing their
      work.
    </p>

    <p class="text-xl">
      I love writing TypeScript-powered React code, but can sling production-level code in any of TypeScript, React,
      GraphQL, CSS, JavaScript, Ruby, Rails, Elixir or Go.
    </p>

    <p>I care a lot about how <strong>the work gets done</strong>, from card kickoffs to retrospectives to developer
      tooling to deployment times. I love the approach of Kaizen: continual improvement of business processes to stream
      line how work is done.</p>

    <p>
      Overall: I want to help whatever team I join to ship great work and to improve ourselves and the business while we
      do it.
    </p>
