    First and foremost: I'm a husband to Sharon and a dad to Ella. Being
    a dad is very awesome. Seeing a little human grow is the most amazing thing. Ella is about to start school this year. And Sharon is now no longer commuting to and teaching in Melbourne every week. It'll be great to have everyone under the same roof again.

    It's now been a year since we moved to <a
      href='https://goo.gl/maps/KLixwMUCxPqwZo1m8'>Warrnambool</a>. It's a lovely change of pace from
    Melbourne and I'm <em>still</em> enjoying the distinct lack of both traffic and distances between things.

  <h3>Work</h3>

  <p>
    I'm working full-time at <a href='https://fatzebra.com'>Fat Zebra</a>, leading their frontend efforts around design systems, React and TypeScript code.
  </p>

  <h3>Writing and other projects</h3>

  <p>
    I released an update to <a href='https://leanpub.com/apollo-handbook'>The Apollo Handbook</a> just today, and hope to finish another chapter of that book by the end of this month.

    I've thought about upgrading <a href='https://activerailsbook.com/'>Active Rails</a> to cater for Rails 7, but I think it's quite an ambitious project and I am not sure if I will have a lot of time for that this year.

    In the last year I've developed a Magic: The Gathering addiction, and have been getting involved in the weekly Magic Commander nights on Fridays. I even attemped to build <a href='https://github.com/radar/mtg'>Magic in Ruby</a>. The game is incredibly simple to pick up, but has a very very deep complexity layer that tickles my brain. As such, the Ruby project will remain incomplete.
