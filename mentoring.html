<h2>1-on-1 Mentoring for Developers</h2>

<em>Available from December 2019</em>

<p class='large'>
  <strong>Do you want to get to the next level as a developer? Accelerate your career by working with me.</strong>
</p>

<p>
  I provide affordable pairing sessions for developers of all skill-levels. We can pair in-person, or over the internet.
</p>

<p>
  Do you need help squashing that super annoying bug? What about getting that important feature over the line? Maybe a
  React component just won't co-operate and the JavaScript involved makes your head spin. Or you need help navigating
  through a gnarly Rails application. I can help with all of these things.
</p>

<p>
  Maybe you're starting out and you're looking for a teacher to help you learn the basics. I can help with that too!
</p>

<p>
  We can sit and pair together for an hour or three on whatever it is you wish. I'm also happy to give advice and to
  answer your general career questions too!
</p>

  succeed as a developer.
