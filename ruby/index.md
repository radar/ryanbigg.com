# A collection of Ruby advice

This is a collection of Ruby advice. This collection falls squarely into the same category as _A Philosophy on Software Design_ by John Ousterhout, or _Tidy First_ by Kent Beck. Some of the advice could even be from the _Principles of Object Oriented Design in Ruby_ by Sandi Metz, or _Eloquent Ruby_ by Russ Olsen. In fact, a lot of the ideas from this book have been inspired from all of those books.

I have two decades of programming experience in various languages, with a primary focus on web application development. The languages I've used during that time have been HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, Ruby, Go and Elixir. I've branded myself as a Ruby on Rails developer for most of that time, but the truth is that I am a bit of a chameleon and can go through the gamut from backend to frontend.

My opinions are coloured by my experience with the style of web application development and the idioms from these languages. That isn't to say these opinions are _right_ or _wrong_, but instead that they're _mine_. If I do this right, you'll find stuff in here that you agree vehemently with and stuff you'll argue with me on.

Code is at its heart subjective and if you ask three developers what they think you'll get back four opinions. These are my opinions.
