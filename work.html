      <p class="text-xl">
        I have contributed extensively to documentation for Ruby and Rails. I started
        writing documentation for Rails in December 2008. The two guides I am best
        known for are the
        <a href="http://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html">Getting Started guide</a>
        and
        <a href="http://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_querying.html">Active Record Querying guide</a>. I also wrote
        the
        <a href="http://guides.rubyonrails.org/engines.html">Engines guide</a> and the
        <a href="http://guides.rubyonrails.org/asset_pipeline.html">Asset Pipeline guide</a>.
      </p>

      <p class="text-xl">
        During 2010, I was contacted by <a href="https://manning.com">Manning</a> to
        write a book for them called
        <a href="manning.com/books/rails-3-in-action">Rails 3 in Action</a>. This
        subsequently went on to produce a second edition, called
        <a href="https://manning.com/books/rails-4-in-action">Rails 4 in Action</a>.
      </p>

      <p class="text-xl">
        After the success of
        <a href="http://manning.com/books/rails-4-in-action">Rails 3 and Rails 4 in Action</a>
        I decided to strike out on my own and become a self-published author. I do
        this through <a href="https://leanpub.com">Leanpub</a> and have published <strong>seven</strong>
        books:

      <ul>
        <li><a href='https://leanpub.com/rails'>Active Rails</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://leanpub.com/multi-tenancy-rails-2">Multitenancy with Rails</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://leanpub.com/toyrobot">Toy Robot walkthrough, in Ruby</a> and another one in <a
            href="https://leanpub.com/elixir-toyrobot">Elixir</a></li>
        <li><a href='https://leanpub.com/maintain-rails'>Maintainable Rails</a></li>
        <li><a href='https://joyofelixir.com'>Joy of Elixir</a></li>
        <li><a href='https://leanpub.com/apollo-handbook'>The Apollo Handbook</a></li>
      </ul>

        You can read more about these books over on
        <a href="/books">my books page</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        To support writing these books, I wrote my own book review tool, called <a

        My role at Covidence was as a senior full-stack developer, leading efforts across the codebase ranging from
        compiling
        a design system in React, CSS & TypeScript to standardise the different components across our application.
      </p>

      <p>
        I worked on a re-work of one of Covidence's major features called "Extraction", and was part of the team that
        launched (and maintained) Extraction 2.0.

        <a href="http://coderacademy.edu.au">Coder Academy</a> runs bootcamps for first-time developers, with the aim of

        At Coder Academy I was the Lead Educator for the Code Like a Girl cohort. I was training a group of 14
        junior-junior
        developers in Ruby on Rails. I was then made redundant in this role due to the impact of COVID.
      </p>

      <p>
        Alongside this work, I was also working in a small team to improve the curriculum for Coder Academy across all of
        their campuses and bootcamps, focussing primarily on Computer Science Fundamentals, Ruby on Rails and JavaScript
        curriculum.

        <a href="http://cultureamp.com">Culture Amp</a> - Junior Engineering Program Lead
      </h3>

      <p class="text-xl">
        <a href="http://cultureamp.com">Culture Amp</a> aims to improve the culture of
        companies around the world.
      </p>

      <p class="text-xl">
        From August 2017 until November 2019, I was the Junior Engineering Program Lead at Culture Amp.
        This job involved recruiting and mentoring junior engineers in Ruby and
        JavaScript (and lots more!) with the goal of training them up to be the next
        great engineers at Culture Amp and in the wider developer community.
      </p>

      <p class="text-xl">
        My work at Culture Amp prior to being the JEP Lead, involved working as a
        Senior Developer with a small (~5-8 people) team of developers to maintain our
        large Rails monolith and to write event-sourced microservices in Elixir, along
        with frontends in React, and associated tech.
      </p>

      <p>
        The role of Junior Engineering Program lead was made redundant at the end of 2019 and I chose to take a redundancy
        payout rather than continue in a different role.
      </p>

      <p>
        I loved working at Culture Amp because I got to do what I love: mentor and grow
        junior developers. I also get lots of opportunities to help out other
        developers by working with them on difficult issues.
