<h2>About Me</h2>
  <div class="entry">
    <h3>
      My name's Ryan Bigg and I enjoy writing (text + code) more than most "normal" people would deem normal. On a
      good day of writing, I can write about 10,000 words. On a bad day, probably 1,500.<br><br>

      I am currently gainfully employed at
      <a href='http://spreecommerce.com'>Spree Commerce</a> as the Community Manager there. My job is to make your
      life with Spree an amazing experience. I triage issues, reply to users' questions on the mailing list and spend the remainder of that time developing on Spree.<br><br>

      I wrote a book called <a href='http://manning.com/katz'>Rails 3 in Action</a> with Yehuda Katz, which <a
        href='http://www.amazon.com/Rails-3-Action-Ryan-Bigg/dp/1935182277'>you should buy</a>, as it teaches you
      how to develop a Rails application the right way using BDD and TDD best practices.<br><br>

      If you're a recruiter contacting me for a job, don't waste your time. I am not currently looking.
    </h3>

    <p>I've been doing Ruby and Rails for about the past 5 years and I consider myself an expert at it. Just look at my <a href='http://stackoverflow.com/users/15245/ryan-bigg'>Stack Overflow score</a>. I don't profess to know everything, I just know a lot and I've got a fair bit of experience in developing Rails applications. To be honest: I learned a lot of what I know from spending <em>way too much</em> time in the #rubyonrails IRC channel on Freenode and Stack Overflow.</p>

    <p>I write mostly about Ruby and Ruby on Rails, <a href="http://manning.com/katz">I've even written a book on it!</a> Other times I write about the community in general in such posts as <a href="http://ryanbigg.com/2010/09/you-suck/">You suck.</a>, <a href="http://ryanbigg.com/2010/09/advanced-rails-documentation/">Advanced Rails Documentation</a> and <a href='http://ryanbigg.com/2011/03/when-to-cuke/'>When to Cuke</a>.</p>
    
    <p>Super-popular posts of mine include the <a
      href='http://ryanbigg.com/2010/12/ubuntu-ruby-rvm-rails-and-you/'>Ubuntu, Ruby, RVM, Rails, and You</a> and
    its "sequel" <a href='http://ryanbigg.com/2011/06/mac-os-x-ruby-rvm-rails-and-you/'>Mac OS X, Ruby, RVM, Rails
      and You</a>, as well as <a href='http://ryanbigg.com/2010/02/congratulations'>Congratulations</a>, a post
    based on a true story about doing Test Driven Development.
    </p>

    <p>I've done <a href='http://contributors.rubyonrails.org/contributors/ryan-bigg/commits'>a lot of work on the official Rails guides</a>, enough to be ranked #17 for all time Rails committers at the time of writing. I've done this by writing such interesting guides as the first copy of the <a href="http://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_querying.html">Active Record Querying Guide</a> as well as beginning work on <a href="http://guides.rubyonrails.org/initialization.html">Rails Internals: The Rails 3 Initialization Process</a>, which is quite a massive beast and one day I will complete it. I also helped out with the <a href='http://guides.rubyonrails.org/configuring.html'>Configuring Rails Applications</a> guide, updating it to Rails 3, and played a large part in the <a href='http://guides.rubyonrails.org/asset_pipeline.html'>Asset Pipeline Guide</a>.</p>

    <p>I'm also writing other guides that don't fit into the Rails guides over on <a href="https://github.com/radar/guides">my personal guides repository</a>.</p>

    <p>Besides writing Gigantic Walls of Text, I also write code. Some of my favourite projects to work on are <a href="http://github.com/radar/forem">forem</a> (a lightweight forum engine built for Rails 3.1+ applications), <a href="http://github.com/fcoury/octopi">octopi</a> (a gem that interacts with the GitHub API) and <a href="http://github.com/radar/summer">summer</a>, a tiny IRC bot framework (with inspiration from <a href="http://github.com/RISCFuture/autumn">autumn</a>).<p>
    
    <p>It's my full-time job to work on the best Rails e-commerce platform, <a href='https://github.com/spree/spree'>Spree</a>, too.</p>

    <p>
      Over my development life I've worked with many, many teams developing Rails applications.
    </p>

    <p>In 2010, I introduced a small team of PHP developers at <a href="http://getup.org.au">GetUp</a> to Ruby on
    Rails and the best practices (such as BDD and Agile) associated with it. All of the developers, aside from
    one, are now doing Ruby on Rails development professionally. The one that's not has chosen to study
    anthropology, but still has a passion for Rails development.</p>

    <p>In 2011, I worked as a Ruby on Rails consultant for <a href='http://rubyx.com'>RubyX</a> in Sydney. It was
    my favourite consulting job so far. I performed code reviews, training and application development and
    really enjoyed it. </p>

    <p>During most of this time, I was working on the first edition of <a href='http://manning.com/katz'>Rails 3 in Action</a> during my spare time. I even found additional time to build a review system called Twist when I found Manning's own to be insufficient for my own needs. In Twist, authors and reviews can <a href='http://ryanbigg.com/about-me/twist-chapter-view.png'>view individual chapters</a> and <a href='http://ryanbigg.com/about-me/twist-note-view.png'>start discussions about particular elements</a>.
   
    <p>In November of 2011, I left RubyX after <a href='http://ryanbigg.com/2011/11/going-on-a-spree/'>being
      offered a job by Spree Commerce</a> to work full time as a community manager and developer of the Spree
    e-commerce platform. This is now my current job.
    </p>

    <p>In 2012, I am still working at Spree as well as working on the second edition for <a href='http://manning.com/katz'>Rails 3 in Action</a>, converting the book to pure RSpec+Capybara from Cucumber,and fixing up changes pointed out by reviewers and readers alike.</p>

    <p>
      I am not actively looking for any more jobs. I said this before, but it bears repeating. If you still really really really feel like contacting me about a job, include the phrase "Bravo Foxtrot Uniform" so I know that you've done your research.
   </p>

    <p>I've recently moved to Melbourne (originally from Adelaide, but I've also lived in Brisbane and Sydney). I attend the local user group meetups when I can, and all the Australian Railscamps, one of which I helped run. I have been known to travel great distances to attend greater conferences. I enjoy speaking and am open for any opportunities in that area.
    </p>

    <p>If you need help with anything Ruby or Rails related, ask me and I can probably help you or get you contact
    with someone who can. Or you could read <a href='http://manning.com/katz'>my book</a> :)</p>
