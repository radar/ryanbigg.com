  <h1>Hello,<br> Anonymous<br> Recruiter!</h1>

  <p class="text-center big text-green-500">
    <strong>I am not currently interested in taking on new jobs from cold contacts.
  </p>

  <p class="text-center big text-green-500">
    Please put some thought into who you are contacting.
  </p>

  <p class="text-center text-gray-300 dark:text-gray-700 my-6">
    It'll work better than mindlessly spamming anyone with a pulse who matches your search terms.
  </p>

  <p class="text-center">
    I detail my "looking for work" status over on my <a href='/work'>/work</a> page.
  </p>

  <p class="text-center">I'd appreciate it if you would read that page before we talked further.</p>

  <p class="text-center">I respect that you're trying to do your job, but some attention to detail is required here.</p>
